<p>While Broque recently pushed out a fantastic release called <a href="http://broque.de/releases/043pseudonimo/043pseudonimoe.htm" target="_blank">Pseudónimo “terra firme e.p.”</a> we thought, we might talk to the grown up (not only) techno netlabel from Germany. And, yes, we squeezed out some interesting questions for you. Keep on reading!</p>

<p><strong>Whose scepter is swinging behind the Broque-curtain?</strong></p>

<div class="interview-answer">
  <p>
    We’ve got two main characters behind our curtain: Tend (Christian Kausch) is the man for promotion, A&amp;R, webdesign, licensing, booking, accounting, shipping, scheduling and all things like these. Granlab (Heiko Schwanz) is the technical director with the key for our servers, the connection to our digital ditributors and also the mastering head. We’ve got a new art director, named Thomas Gumprecht, and many other helpers, we can’t exist without.

<p><small>Music connects! Friends for lifetime, partners on Broque Netlabel: Christian and Heiko</small></p>

<p><strong>Most netlabels publish their music only as digital downloads. You follow a mixed up strategy and distribute your music as mp3 and vinyl. Why do you do so?</strong></p>

<div class="interview-answer">
  <p>
    We were never friends of seperating drawers or formats. I think, so we’ve got <strong>the chance to get attention by all music-fans without any restrictions.</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<p><strong>When you publish a new vinyl, how do you choose the tracks? Are there any guidelines you follow?</strong></p>

<div class="interview-answer">
  <p>
    We’ve got a very nice artist pool and get many demos every week. Our only guideline is, that the music must have soul and groove. It’s very important for us to get to know the artists. We want to work together to get new inspirations and hope they get also new experiences by working together with us and our other artists. It’s so nice to see, if new people come together making new projects or just have a good time by exchange or something like that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s terrible, because there are so many people who can’t talk a normal sentence with you, or they have ideas from another world – so we must say “No way!”.
  </p>

<p><strong>You also sell your music also digitally - for instance on beatport. Was it difficult to sell your music through beatport? How did you manage to sell your music there?</strong></p>

<div class="interview-answer">
  <p>
    We’ve got a digital distributor, but also single contracts with separate platforms. <strong>We only sell the music as mp3 we sell as vinyl</strong>, too. We need the additional profit in this case. Our general mp3-way is free.
  </p>
</div>

<p><strong>Is selling MP3s a lucrative way for musicians to earn money? Would you advise netlabels to sell their music through a music-shop such as beatport?</strong></p>

<div class="interview-answer">
  <p>
    <strong>Yes, you can earn money with it. But I can’t advice it in every case.</strong> We don’t switch our label philosophy into only selling, because we think, we lose many fans with it. At this time, we are a good reference for our artists. In another way we would be a soulless label like others on beatport without an own face. <strong>As netlabel you can reach thousands of people, as mp3-sell-label with the same concept you’ve got maybe 20 till 50 downloads.</strong> Ok, you’ve got the chance to get more, but only great music isn’t enough. And you must know: Netlabel users and people who buy the music via beatport and so on are different target groups. So I must ask, what is more important for you, if you totalize?
  </p>
</div>

<p><strong>If somebody discovers Broque the first time, what five releases should he definetely listens to?</strong></p>

<div class="interview-answer">
  <p>
    Its very hard, because we aren't a label for one night. So I hope I found the right style mix for the first date with us. But I think, you can find some more treasures on our site, if these teasers are interesting for you:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Mike Breitfeld - Landflucht (broque 003)</strong><br /> Track: <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/brq03MikeBreitfeldLandfluchtEP/02Technique4.mp3">Technique4</a> (MP3)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It was our third EP and a real breakthrough. The chosen track is full of electric current and still one of our favorites. Its also a licenced demo track for Native Instruments Traktor DJ Studio 2.6.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>10 Jahre Oderaufbrot The Remixes (broque 005)</strong><br /> Track: <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/brq05ODERAUFBROT10JahreDieRemixtracks/9RMXcontrolfreak.mp3">The Caine Controlfreak (Granlab Remix)</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I chose this Track, because it was a part of the remixes of our 10 years anniversary compilation CD. The CD was the start of our label and also the beginning of a very successful compilation series. And this remix was the best ever of Granlabs works, I think.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Cheslo Spring Droids EP (broque 021)</strong><br /> Track: <a href="http://www.broque.de/Music/brq21_cheslo-spring_droids_ep/broque021_spring_droids_ep_04-cheslo-mjidou.mp3">Mjidou</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It was hard to decide between Lowtec and Cheslo to find a perfect example of our deep side. But I think, Cheslo was a real surprise with his great EP in his very own style and a real genius in his arts. But I really love Lowtecs EP, too!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Max Cavalerra Naturphenomenon (broque 024)</strong><br /> Track: <a href="http://www.broque.de/Music/brq24_max_cavalerra-naturphenomenon_ep/broque024_naturphenomenon_ep_04-max_cavalerra-der_mensch_und_seine_gaensehaut.mp3">Der Mensch und seine Gnsehaut</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Max is the artist with the most tracks on broque.de. The history of his nature phenomenon is very interesting. At first, nobody took note of it. But step by step, the people found this great fusion of music and now this EP is his most succesfull one on Broque. Two Tracks are now only available on Karmarouge Rec.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Nils Hoffmann Kurz &amp; Klein EP (broque 035)</strong><br /> Track: <a href="http://web0.pv220.ncsrv.de/music/brq36_nils_hoffmann-kurz_und_klein_ep/brq36_nils_hoffmann-kurz_und_klein_ep-02_goodbye_glamour.mp3">Goodbye Glamour</a><br /> Maybe our greatest success ever? Ok, the tastes are different. But a real sample of our open sound policy. Music can bring you so much fun
