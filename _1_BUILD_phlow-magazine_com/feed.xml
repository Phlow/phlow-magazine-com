One of those allready well-known artists in the world of creative commons reggae is Ras Amerlock. The American already released several times on [Jahtari]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/?s=Jahtari). So it's no surprise, that the close relationship between LCL and Jahtari convinced him to release his groovy bass odditiy on LCL.

&lt;p&gt;Infrequently I stumble upon musicians who really impress me. Most of the time musicians only think about their music, compose good or bad songs and often forget about entertainment and other arts. On the contrary Tracky Birthday introduces you to music by letting you see the full scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His raps won’t introduce you to the world of BlingBling-Diamond-Shit. Neither they’ll throw some trash on you of his ghetto-childhood. No, in his raps and music Tracky Birthday reflects our society in the digital age. It’s an album filled with music history. An album which mashes up sound of our computer-childhood with pop-anthems from Michael Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on top you listen to fast raps, playing with the english language like a true digital native. Rub your ears for this incredible german rapper, born into a global world where we all live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Tracky Birthday where the Wu meets the Bat…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bootyclipse&quot;&gt;Bootyclipse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracky Birthday aka Dennis Knopf won a Prize for Online Art at the 22nd Filmwinter Festival 2009 for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/dennisknopf&quot;&gt;Bootyclipse Video Series&lt;/a&gt;. Watch this video and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2007, a German rapper and a debutant net artist Dennis Knopf opened a channel on YouTube that he named Bootyclipse. Every video broadcasted on that channel consists of those candid moments, prolonged to 40-60 seconds. Dennis has collected fragments from more than twenty videos where a girl who is going to shake her booty in front of a camera has not appeared in the frame yet, and looped these moments, leaving the music to play in real time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/infinite_seance_2/&quot;&gt;Read more in on this website…&lt;/a&gt; (scroll down on the page to read the excerpt)&lt;a href=&quot;http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/infinite_seance_2/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Superloader makes that sort of house music which seems to never stop. If you're not down in the club with the crew, you feel the lax mood. The night is long and Supafeed sucks us into that endless groove we get hypnotized by the whole night. Just take &quot;Let it off&quot;. You start the track and the groove is there. It will still be the same, when the track stops. Nevertheless you get some damn nice sounds while seesawing under the disco ball with Superloader.

This is an album of deft and clever combinations that soothe and then surprise the listener, as exquisite jazz chords and chromatics give way to drill and bass rasps and glitchy repetition, before falling luxuriously back into a pleasing bath of strings or mellow guitar. Bitbasic presents music that plays on the tensions between heavily quantized, truncated sound and free style playing; indulging in a playground of cut ups and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At over fifty minutes, this wonderfully cohesive album treats the listener to a variety of gear shifts and mood changes that make the whole experience engaging and enervating from beginning to end. Whether it is the rapid, funky breaks and signature changes of “Realization”, the acoustic guitar sound, descending Resident style analogue synth sighs and stuttering, reverby drums of “Damaged Beyond Repair”, or the surprising but beautifully executed cover of “Ain’t No Sunshine”, this is an album that will make you grin at the pleasure of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point during Roxy and Elsewhere, Frank Zappa declares that “Jazz isn’t dead, it just smells funny”: a statement that adroitly encapsulated the moribund state of much of what jazz had become by the mid 1970’s. For Zappa, a playful and creative engagement with jazz, and his combinations thereof with other musical styles, served as a platform for countless reinventions. While George Duke, Ruth Underwood, Don Preston, Napolean Murphy Brock et al may have been superseded by samples, perhaps, in some tenuous way, Bitbasic’s Sprinkling Rainbows is another step along a path of enlightened, intelligent and wry experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--adsense--&gt;

&quot;Synesthesia&quot; is colourful like the album cover itself. Listen to that pop appeal in &quot;Cry now&quot;. AEED rolls out the bass as a pumping fundament and than gets lost in melodies. This album has nothing to do with loop-orientated Hip Hop instrumentals. AEED feds his music with sweeping synths, funky or jazzy melodies which seem to glide easily from the keyboard into the corners of his broken beats.

Sometimes &quot;Synesthesia&quot; is full of melancholy like in &quot;Strange Dreams&quot;. Sometimes AEED delivers us funky anthems like &quot;Elephants Dance&quot; bouncing on a sparkeling bassline. If you like electronica, chip music and if you have some b-boy-blood in your venes. This is the exact soundtrack. Error Broadcast gets bigger with each new release. Can't wait for more eye candy!

Like [Apes on Tapes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/?s=Apes+on+Tapes) also Grillo is on the spearhead of modern beats. After his great debut called &quot;Fireworks&quot; the label refined his tracks with five excellent remixes.

[Grillo - &quot;Brown Box (Fulgeance Remix)&quot; (MP3)](http://mp3.phlow.de/phlow_2010/02._fulgeance_-_fireworks_remixes_-_brown_box_fulgeance_interstella_funk_remix_.mp3)

The sound of Grillo is pure, very digital and funky. On &quot;Fireworks&quot; we listen to crispy beats, clicks, snares and solid kicks. Most of the tracks are build on some melodic grooves. This made me rewind the album to listen again to slow movers like &quot;Clicks&quot; or the fantastic hit &quot;Be aware&quot;.

Now we get the remixes and what can I say? I like the reworks even a little bit more. Each producer kept the digital sound of Grillo but managed to throw some of his delicate herbs and skills into the bowl. Just listen to the remix of &quot;Be Aware&quot; of Costa. Filled with some humour we nod to a straight-into-your-face pop hook. My favorite right now is the jazzy and funky retouch of Fulgeance on &quot;Brown Box&quot;. If this one won't make you smile and move, I don't know...

**Thumbs up, once again for the skills, beats and taste of Homework Records! Italys finest!**

/images/urbanexplorersklein.jpg&quot;Since his first release called &quot;Re-Locate&quot;, I wait for more music by Mentz. He is the classic producer who diggs deep into his vinyl selection to combine whisphering samples of jazz with some carefull beats in slow motion. Mentz spent last summer performing live with musicians and did extensive collaborations with a violinist called Roosje Raab, a Clarinet player called Wouter Suren and Krisztián Ákos Muhari on the trumpet. The result is this wonderful little EP.

I hope it won't take years again till the next Mentz release :)

I hyped this DubTechno release many times, I am sorry for that. But this classy DubTechno album by Marko Fürstenberg has to be promoted also here on Phlow-Magazine.com because it is **still one the best DubTechno albums ever** and **one of the first netaudio longplayer** which grabbed my attention from beginning to end.

&quot;Gesamtlaufzeit&quot; is so amazing because you travel together with the artist from music gig to music gig. For his album Marko Fürstenberg composed smooth rockin DubTechno-tracks along with calm ambientish songs. Some of the songs where produced while travelling through Germany. If you imagine how the musician sits in the train, looks out the window and sees all the trees, houses, landscapes flying by, the sound fits perfect. Also it's a perfect statement how you get sucked into techno...

**A netaudio classic!**

Julia Kotowski aka Entertainment For The Braindead got bonded by the strings of her banjo. She discovered sweet moments, beautiful melodies and that slight sad mood what shines through all her songs. We are happy to get the chance to listen to them. Just dive into her world and get carried away. I won't say no more, just listen, enjoy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://entertainmentforthebraindead.com/index.php?loc=shop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;get your own hand-crafted record&lt;/a&gt; at her website. Like always there will be only a few unique copies.
