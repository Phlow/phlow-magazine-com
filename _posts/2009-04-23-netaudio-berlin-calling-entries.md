Or Musicfreak?** Than read on: Wow, this year, Germany offers you two important dates to visit our country: [Cologne Commons](http://cologne-commons.de/) and [Netaudio Berlin](http://www.netaudioberlin.de/).

The second Netaudio Berlin Festival lifts its curtain on 8th to 11th of October 2009 to the public. In Berlin Netaudio Berlin will celebrate four days everything related to Creative Commons, Netlabels, Netaudio and free music culture.
