***Do you remember Anamanaguchi?*** // The _8-bit punk band from New York City_ had an EP on 8bitpeoples.com a while ago, and Phlow [featured]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music-video/323-video-sting-operation-for-anamanaguchi) their "Okami"-inspired music video for the hitsingle "Sting Operation". Just recently, the NES ladylovers released their first full-length album "Dawn Metropolis" on 12" vinyl. It's not free but you should take a look at the microsite dawnmetropolis.com!<!--more-->

<!--adsense-->

Every song of the album is accompanied by a fullscreen video in blazing 8-bit aesthetics.Â  Abstract patterns mix with scences inspired by 80's videogames, pixelpower in 52 colors, psychedlic mayhem! Check this high energy VJ set by [Paris Graphics](http://www.parisgraphics.com/) and the ingenious [David Mauro](http://www.dmauro.com/). Great fun, especially if you let the music run at high volume.
