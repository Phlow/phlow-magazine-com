***100 Times MiMi Music*** // The Japanese/ Portugese MiMi Netlabel is not mentioned too often over here at Phlow Magazine. Dunno why this is the case- a deficiency in quality is not the reason. [Let's correct this lapse]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/pop/1148-m100-mimi) and talk about the compilation "M100", MiMi put online as their 100th release!

To my ears, the influence of Japanese music is bigger on the spectrum [MiMi](http://www.clubotaku.org/mimi/) represents. **This is not J-Pop but Japanese Pop**. Subtle, melodic, eccentric every now and then. Mawkish by chance.

The compilation starts with Asako Fujimoto a.k.a. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/asakomusic" target="_blank">asakomusic</a>. She travels around the World and accordingly, her music is conglomerate of Folklore and awkward Pop music. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/caroline" target="_blank">Caroline Lufkin</a> afterwards conducts a hymnal Popsong, with some electronics assembling her otherworldly voice. Bewitching. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/izumimisawa" target="_blank">Izumi Mizawa</a>'s music sound like processing the lush and warm melodies of Caroline to something artificial- a study on aural harmony

Reiko Matane a.k.a. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lmprs" target="_blank">le mépris</a> a.k.a. [pillowdiver](http://www.myspace.com/pillowdiver) is well known for her album on [Aerotone](http://aerotone.300l600.de/index.php?id=2,95,0,0,1,0). The track on "M100" is a shoegazing piece of Dronepop... solid. Back to the real Pop music with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lindabjalla" target="_blank">Linda Bjalla</a> (Izumi Suzuki). Piano-drive neoromanticism, not shying away from glockenspiel and reverberated vocals. Got me, somehow. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/odagirimiki" target="_blank">Miki Odagiri</a> deliver <a href="http://www.creation-centre.com/" target="_blank">Creation Centre</a>-style Avantgarde Pop with loads of loose ends- nice, but I have a certain problem with the vocals...
