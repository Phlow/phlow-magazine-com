***Summer's got Bettina in its claws*** // I'm leaving for a two weeks vacation this Saturday. Suitcases have to be stuffed and friends have to be convinced to take care of mail, plants and cat. And as most people, I got myself some new books to browse in the scorching heat of sun-burned beaches (in my case, the white shores of the Baltic Sea). **Before I'm off, here's five recent Netaudio releases you should consider downloading.** Listener's Digest, you know?

## Portformat - "Classics"

[<img class="left size-full wp-image-1242" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/portformat_front.jpg"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/portformat_front.jpg)

[Portformat](http://myspace.com/portformat) a.k.a. Ibrahima M'Bodji is a German/ Senegalsese producer. In 2009, Ibrahim will release his debut album by the hands of [Tokyo Dawn](http://www.tokyodawn.net/) records but before we can download a fine collection of mellow, mostly instrumental Hip Hop tunes. **Organic and jazzy beats**, musically speaking close to his buddy [Comfort Fit](http://www.comfortfit.de/) plus some more _Soul_.

## Mobydick & Plaistow - "Tarial EP" (eDogm)

[<img class="left size-full wp-image-1243" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/edo023-500.jpg"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/edo023-500.jpg)

Critically acclaimed Geneve Jazztrio [Plaistow](http://www.myspace.com/plaistowmusic) hooked up with Moroccan MC [Mobydick](http://www.myspace.com/m0bydick) to form a new band: [Mobystow](http://www.myspace.com/mobystow). Mobydick spits in French and Darija language (which is a n Arabian idiom). That sounds fresh and interesting, and his associative, **spoken word-style flow** is unique. Plaistow add their visions of high energy **Post-Bop** to make this EP something new and outstanding.

## Kauders - "Brian Invited June" (Bird Song)

[<img class="left size-full wp-image-1244" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kauders_500.jpg"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kauders_500.jpg)

Gottfried Kauders is guitarist of [Automassage](http://www.myspace.com/automassage) and [Code Inconnu](http://www.myspace.com/codeinconnu), two bands that empathically push the borders of experimental Rock music. There is a certain sickness about both bands mainly due to the sluggish guitar play of Kauders. For his solo output, Kauders got into **Avant-Garde Pop** rather than Rock. But his style is not to mistaken. Strange music, unique music, but beautiful music above all.

## Deastro - "Grower EP" (RCRDLBL)

[<img class="left size-full wp-image-1246" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/art.jpg"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/art.jpg)

[Deastro](http://myspace.com/deastro) is a recording artists from Detroit, Michigan who is promoted by [Ghostly](http://ghostly.com/) recordlabel as a wunderkind in **Shoegaze Electronica**. Randolph Chabot a.k.a. Deastro is about to release his debut LP with Ghostly but his epic "Grower EP" is online for free via [RCRDLBL](http://rcrdlbl.com). Home grown IDM, sweetish melodies and uplifting beats - somewhere between chip tune, _Boards of Canda_ and _My Bloody Valentine_.

## **Fine Before You Came - "sfortuna"****

[<img class="left size-full wp-image-1247" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pib016.jpg"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pib016.jpg)

OK, I don't know much about Italian Indierock outfit [Fine Before You Came](http://www.finebeforeyoucame.com). Flip of [Zymogen](http://www.zymogen.net) sent me the link, asking if I would fancy some tough Rock music. I do. FBYC released their new record "sfortuna" as a free download on their website. The band exists for nearly ten years now and is quite successful in Italy. They play awkward melodic and aggresive **Post-Hardcore** that strikes a chord with me. Super!
