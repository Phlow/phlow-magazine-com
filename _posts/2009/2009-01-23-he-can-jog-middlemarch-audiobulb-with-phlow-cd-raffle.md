***Fractal Folk from the US*** // After the great success of our Liger give-away, this time it’s UK record label Audiobulb entering the raffle ring with the wonderful “Middlemarch” CD by Brooklyn boy Eric Schoster. Eric calls himself he can jog and produces fractal Folk and Pop music. He appeared on Hippocamp, Nexsound, 12rec. and is friends to the guys at Luvsound.

Eric Schoster produced and recorded the follow-up to his 2004 debut with a bunch of friends and family, among these Sebastian Kruger of [Inlets](http://www.inletsmusic.com/) and Kevin Gipson aka [allthatfall](http://allthatfall.com/). [Nicholas Sanborn](http://www.myspace.com/madeofoak) borrows his voice and composition talents for one tune (he also did the artwork). Fine guests, all together, and they make "Middlemarch" a fine record.

Eric transforms the warmth and richness of analogue instruments into splintered collages of electronic music. One part of his music is highly processed textures, another other part is low-key melodies and hypnotic rhythms. "Suite Part Four" opens the album with a krauty Poptune that shines forth with a sparkling synth motive. Melancholia and interlaced percussive elements prove central to the **He Can Jog** sound. "Suite Part Three"  is a bit closer to what you might call a "song". Mellow stage piano chords mix with _Prefuse 73_ style beats... super!

You could mention _Four Tet_ or _Cluster_ for comparison, I can hear a lot of [adcBicycle](http://www.adcbicycle.com/) in his music as well. Eric oscillates from crackling Ambient ("Agnes") to IDM- and Hip Hop influenced Electronica without loosing his special cut-up sound. "Pan-Friend Fern" for instance is an absolute stunning mixture of abstract Hip Hop beats and textural Ambient, while  "Contractors and Architects" (as featured on "[Fall is for Lovers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/pop/851-catchy-pop-tunes-fall-is-for-lovers)") is a comparatively straight-forward Popsong. Sanborn's vocals are bewitching. **He Can Jog** kisses us goodbye with the spirally and mesmerizing "Suite Part One and Two".
