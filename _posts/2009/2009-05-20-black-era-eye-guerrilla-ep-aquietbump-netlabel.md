Maybe Black Era is a dark reflection of the Berlusconi-ruled italian empire. Or maybe it is a reflection of the bad side of the italian soul called Mafia. Maybe none of these conclusions are right. What I can hear for sure are some dusky sounds, creeping slowly on the floor like Massive Attack, Leftfield or Portishead in their brightest moments of opposition.<!--more-->

Black Era don't only produce gloomy music, they want to make a statement against fascism, suppressing people and all other ugly people... Unfortunately I don't understand italian, but I suppose that's why on the release page of  "Third eye guerrilla EP" they linked people like [Enrico Mattei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Mattei), [Pier Paolo Pasolini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Paolo_Pasolini) or [Giovanni Falcone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Falcone) who where used with their voice to make a statement.

Great release!

PS: Just one word about aquietbump netlabel: They do a great job of promoting their releases. The picture above was delivered in a extra presskit for the media. Thumbs up!
