Lately it's been a little bit quiet here... The reason is simple: Together with some enthusiastic folks in Cologne/Germany we are planing a conference and music festival about free culture, creative commons and of course music! One of the heads behind our music festival kicked off our event with an extraordinary compilation: In the last months musician, photographer and netaudio-freak psycoded compiled some beautiful free music from cologne and around. Give the compilation a listen and meet us in Cologne on 12th and 13th of June 2009.<!--more-->

It seems the time is right. Right for some change, for discussions and for sharing. On [Cologne Commons](http://www.Cologne-Commons.de) we will present you workshops, panels and two superfueled evenings of music. This compilation is just the tip of the iceberg what's going to happen.

The only sad fact is: The conference will be in German but in the evening the language will be universal: music!

So dig this compilation fused together by [psycoded](http://psycoded.de) and delivered with heart!
