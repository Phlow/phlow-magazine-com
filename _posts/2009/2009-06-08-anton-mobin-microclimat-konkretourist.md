***Intensive Musique Concrète*** // French experimental music composer Anton Mobin released a 15-minutes piece of highly processed field recordings at Cologne konkretourist Netlabel.  "Micro-Climat" consists of recording from North and South France condenses versatile soundscapes and textures to an intensive piece of Music Concrète.

What struck me about "Micro-Climat" on first touch was the bass-heavy physicalness of [Anton Mobin](http://audioblog.arteradio.com/ANTON_MOBIN)s' aural quilt. He interlaces field recordings with musical elements (some percussive, some traces of instruments) and drops smithereens of conversation (French language). [Mobin](http://audioblog.arteradio.com/ANTON_MOBIN) a.k.a. Anthony Baron uses the full range of the audible spectrum, from high frequent noises to subsonic audio events. Most of the time, his Music Concrète-composition is beautifully pure although most sources are hard to guess. Every now and then, however,  [Anton Mobin](http://audioblog.arteradio.com/ANTON_MOBIN) radically enhances the  intensity of his track, resulting in bursts of curiously _non_-aggressive noise I have scarcely heard before.

Rich and refreshing, [Anton Mobin](http://audioblog.arteradio.com/ANTON_MOBIN) places himself right between the IDM-influenced Electro-acoustica of [d'incise]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/754-incise-stase-contre-resting-bell-netlabel), [Preslav Literary School]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/620-preslav-literary-school-autumn-bricolage-clinical-archives) and Brooklyn noise pioneers _Black Dice_. Thanks to [konkretourist](http://konkretourist.de/) Netlabel which I discovered only with this release!

By the way, **Marco Medkour, one half of [konkretourist](http://konkretourist.de/), will present his "[Soundmap of Cologne](http://soundmap-cologne.de/)" at the [Cologne Commons](http://cologne-commons.de) festival this weekend, 12th to 13th of June.** Another exciting project.
