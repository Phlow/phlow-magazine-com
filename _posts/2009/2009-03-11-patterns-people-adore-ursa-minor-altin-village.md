***High Voltage Mathematics*** // Patterns are Germany's finest Postpunk outfit. There's not too much competition, I admit, but the three guys from Cologne can easily keep up with their idols in North America. With maximum amazement I found out that their label put the bands' early EPs online for free download. Don't own the "People I Adore" 7"? Download NOW!

In the meantime, the band released a split LP with [The Falcon Five](http://www.myspace.com/thefalconfive) and another shared 7" with [fuckuismyname](http://www.fuckuismyname.de/), and  [Patterns](http://www.myspace.com/pttrns)' full-length debut is about to be done according to the band's blog. A good moment to get familiar with **Germany's finest Postpunk outfit**!

The band play nervous and awkward DC-style Punk- and Mathrock, charged top to bottom. Their melodies are unconsumed, all grooves and breaks come tight. Of course I have to mention _Q & Not U_ and _Les Savy Fav_, but I guess [Patterns](http://www.myspace.com/pttrns) are fine with this comparison. Sooo good.
