The second release on the redesigned (and formerly known as DCC records) netlabel modularfield is a moving train. Straight pumping grooves with mesmerizing patterns, that unveil slowly in tracks with over 9 minutes of playing time. The four tracks on this records were meant to be played at the club - or with the repeat flag set at home.<!--more-->

There is more to the tracks, that let the train keep rolling in. The name "Aufbruchstimmung (atmosphere of departure)" is clearly meant pragmatically. Don't hesitate - celebrate. Old wisdom like this, is about to happen once again. I visited some of the Modularfield-parties and can agree, that they mean it like this. Turn the volume up and let the things go through.

Oeler is also working on live-sets. The Modularfiled-webseite says about this record: "Meanwhile Oeler made a lot of tracks between minimal / techno / techhouse / house and tribal and wants to introduce his favourite Songs of 2007 and his first live production."
