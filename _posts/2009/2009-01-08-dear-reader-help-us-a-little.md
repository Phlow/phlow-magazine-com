***Doing Promotion*** // Last November I sent a little promotion package to one of the leading computer magazines in Germany called <a href="www.heise.de/ct/ " target="_blank">c't magazin</a>. It included a CD-ROM with our most [successful compilation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/dj-mixes-and-compilations)s and an info-sheet [about Phlow-Magazine.com]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about) and the [Creative Commons]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/information-what-is-creative-commons) Movement. The delicious music gift was successful and they wrote about us. Now we want to do it again with other magazines, with your help!<!--more-->

Before I sent the little promo-package to c't magazine, I asked them if they would like to receive a "gift". Fortunately I knew one of the editors of c't magazin, because I write for them about web technologies from time to time. With this little extra credit, I got the chance and some more attention than usually. And even though the editor didn't dig our music style so much, **he wrote a nice review about us** empasizing the interesting creative commons music culture. The review wasn't only printed in the magazine itself, you can <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/08/26/214/" target="_blank">read the german review also online</a>.

Afterwards a lot of my friends congratulated me, that Phlow-Magazine.com made it into a print magazine. I was amazed, that still so many people read link tips. One of my girl friends sa

## Where you can help us!

Of course, there are several ways to support the magazine to reach new readers. You can <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url={{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}&title=Magazine%20for%20free%20mp3%20music%20culture" target="_blank">write a review on Stumble Upon</a> or bookmark our articles on websites like <a href="http://Delicious.com" target="_blank">Delicious.com</a> or <a href="http://www.mister-wong.com/" target="_blank">Mister Wong</a>... But **to reach new reader- and listenerships for your netlabel or blog you have to make good promotion not only on the web**. And that's the point, where you come in!

I would like to send some more promotion material to magazines worldwide to get more attention for the artists, netlabels and of course Phlow-Magazine.com. **Do you know interesting magazines who write also reviews about websites?** I am thinking for example about magazines for instruments like the german <a href="http://www.keys.de/" target="_blank">Keys</a>, <a href="http://www.keyboards.de/" target="_blank">keyboards</a> or <a href="http://www.beat.de/" target="_blank">Beat</a>.

Unfortunately music magazines in general in Germany don't write about netlabels and free music at all. A horrible desaster, if you ask me. That's why I want to twist it into the other way.

**Can you name me some really interesting computer-, live style- or similiar magazines you like to read and think they are worth some promo material?**

And while we talk about promotion: If you have some stickers or buttons left, sent them to `M. Sauer, Cranachstraße 25, 50733 Köln, Germany`, and I will put them into the package.**
