**Three Times Weird Folk From France**</a> // François Virot released a wonderful LP at the French Clapping Music recordlabel. For the release party in Paris, François gave away 100 copies of a CD-R featuring two friendly artists and two unpublished tunes by Virot himself. Soon after, Clapping Music decided to go online with exactly these tracks for free download. Hooray!<!--more-->

The compilation brings together three young French artist, all situated between edgy Pop- and some kind of lo-fi Folkmusic. [Karaocake](http://www.myspace.com/karaocake) is the solo outlet of Paris-based Camille Chambon. With four self-published records and a lot of tourring through Europe, the US and Canada in the back, Chambon comes off quite professional. Her loose lo-fi Pop miniatures don't do fortunately. **Charming introspect home recordings**, and a beautiful voice.

[Marie Marie Cells](http://www.myspace.com/mariemariecells) hit the spot more rude. Rumbling bass meets juvenile male vocals meets lurching keys that sound like 90's Shoegaze. A strange combination, but somehow this cheeky Paris _boygroup_ has a knack as well.

[François Virot](http://www.myspace.com/francoisvirot) finally delights us with two high quality outtakes from his recent "[Yes or No](http://clappingmusic.com/index.php?action=releaseDetails&release_id=10)" album. In brutal falsetto, only acompanied by his acoustic guitar, Virot performs his awkward Indiepop. Somewhere between _Panda Bear_ and _Stephen Malkmus_, **François Virot proves himself as a skilled songwriter with loads of ideas and a stunning feel for melodies**.
