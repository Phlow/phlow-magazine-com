***Dreamy Indie/Folk-Pop*** // After touring internationally for two years, the Groningen (Holland) based indie/folk-group The Black Atlantic have recently put out their debut album. "Reverence for Fallen Trees" is a lovely affair of melancholy moods. The album is packed with mostly folk influenced acoustic pop attached to sweet and soft vocal harmonies, soft strummed guitars, piano and minimal percussion.

**It all started with a Valentine's gift.** It was back in 2006 when Geert van der Velde wrote a song for his girlfriend. She must have liked it. They married and Geert formed a band. [The Black Atlantic](http://www.theblackatlantic.com) was born. Two years, several gigs and countless jams later, the group has recorded its debut album, "[Reverence for Fallen Trees](http://www.beepbeep.nl/the-black-atlantic-reverence-for-fallen-trees/)". It was [created over the fall of 2008 in a log cabin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWZZlmOcZ2Y) in the [Adirondack Mountains](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Adirondack_Mountains?uselang=de).

It seems as if Velde and his band took a deep breath to capture the world around and inside of them - "Reverence for Fallen Trees" is the introspective and intimate outcome. For the lovers of soft tunes and sweet melodies, The Black Atlantic might be a new favorite band that it's really worth watching out for.



**Virtual omnipresence.** The Black Atlantic do the right thing. As an indie band, the dutch four-piece has not only signed to a wonderful and dedicated netlabel ([Beep! Beep!](http://www.beepbeep.nl)), they are also virtually omnipresent. Next to their official site, they use Twitter, Myspace, Last.fm, Hyves, Facebook, Mininova and man, they are on Wikipedia! That's how it should be! Another great thing: [You can get their album on vinyl and/or cd](http://beepbeep.myshopify.com/products/reverence-for-fallen-trees-1). Even better: You can see them live on their [upcoming european tour](http://www.theblackatlantic.com/shows.html).
