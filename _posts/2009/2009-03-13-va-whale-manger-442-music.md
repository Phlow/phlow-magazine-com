***Xmas Muzak*** // Australian record- and Netlabel 4-4-2 Music released a wonderful compilation in December 2008 I only stumbled about now. As the weather in Northern Germany is exactly like it normally is on Christmas Eve 'round here, maybe a review makes sense. "A Whale in the Manger" brings together six artists and their interpretation of Christmas carols.

[Telafonica - "Angels We Have Heard On High" (MP3)](http://www.archive.org/ (MP3)/442-net-009/02AngelsWeHaveHeardOnHigh.mp3)
  
[Eliza Magill - "Joy To The World" (MP3)](http://www.archive.org/ (MP3)/442-net-009/03JoyToTheWorld.mp3)

Actually, this compilation is only _four_ songs and _one_ musical collective:

<img class="alignleft" src="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/christmas-songs-16.jpg"Sydney-based [Telafonica](http://telafonica.blogspot.com/) start with their version of "Angels We Have Heard On High". Absolutely intriguing, the band contrasts their coldish Trip Hop / Electronica sound with the heavenly "_Gloria, in excelsis Deo_" hookline of the traditional carol. Wonderful voices (Magill/ Elmer), wonderful _trumpets_.

<img class="alignleft" src="http://nethymnal.org/img/a/d/o/Adoration%20of%20the%20Shepherds,%20Jacob%20Jordaens%20(1593-1678).jpg"Second is [Telafonica](http://telafonica.blogspot.com/) songstress [Eliza Magill](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2ieWLhfph_I/SZZXEdRADPI/AAAAAAAAAZM/XOHGzMVtMAo/s1600-h/eliza-recording-11-2-09.jpg). Her version of "Joy to the World" is far more traditional, but nonetheless skilful and beautiful. In duet with the male vocals (Adrian Elmer), the whole version sounds like a light-hearted version of _Low_ (who must be names when it comes to Christmas carols of course). Fully acoustic, intimate recording, a heartbreaker.

<img class="alignleft" src="http://washingtonmo.com/christmas/images/1038b.jpg"The [Lessons in Time](http://www.myspace.com/lessonsintime) hails from New South Wales and deliver the lopsided part of this compilation. Pretentious on first listen, a revelation at repeated performance! Blake Wassell, the lad behind the moniker, delivers an emotional lo-fi version of "O Holy Night" and raises the hymnal potential of the original to higher power. The Australian [Liger]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music-marketing-promotion/822-liger-crash-symbols-beatismurder-with-phlow-cd-raffle)? Oh, he plays in [Telafonica](http://telafonica.blogspot.com/) as well!

Eventually, [Telafonica](http://telafonica.blogspot.com/) join for a last hymnal. "Good News (Sing for Joy)" I wasn't able to identify properly, but who cares? Trip Hop and electronic music-influenced Popmusic, only the female vocals fit the concept better.

Thank _heavens_ to [nethymnal.org](http://nethymnal.org/) for the spiritual guidance!
