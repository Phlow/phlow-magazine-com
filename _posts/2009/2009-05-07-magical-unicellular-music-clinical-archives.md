***RU-ral Psychedelic Rock*** // If you are a keen follower of Phlow Magazine, you know that I regularly write about Russian and East European musicians. Up next we have got V.O.M., rather an idea than a band, acting simultaneously from (at least) three different cities, [all in the name of hypnotic Krautrock]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/experimental/1168-magical-unicellular-music-clinical-archives).

**V.O.M.** [again](http://rubored.wordpress.com/2006/09/06/vom-at-analogundehrlichde-vesna-sveta-lp/). The name stands for **Magical Unicellular Music**, and this strange name makes sense on different levels. _Magical_ - something happens between the tracks, something unexpected, something one can not explain. Black magic rituals, Voodoo, call me names. _Unicellular_ - the most simple form of life, evolutions successful all-in-one model. Reduced to the max. _Music_ - well, yeah, music! **V.O.M.** is primitive, hypnotic, threatening... I'm prone to call it Minimal.

**V.O.M.** was born from Minsk performance collective **Solntsetsvety** (Солнцецветы). On this release for the Russian [Clinical Archives](http://www.clinicalarchives.spyw.com/) Netlabel, **Magical Unicelluar Music** is **V.O.M. IV** and **V.O.M. V**, Minsk and Moscow, respectively. Two bands, united by the ideas given above.

Listening to "**Камень**", it is hard to distinguish who is who. Both bands play primitive, noise-driven Krautrock, repetitiv and hypnotic. Instruments are guitar-bass-drums, plus sporadic electronic gimmicks, the whole thing mainly instrumental. **V.O.M.** record music half-improvised, with a stunning amount of DIY/Punk-inspired energy that sets them apart from New Age and esoteric music. In my opinion, early _Can_, the endless songs of _Neu!_ and 80s' Postpunk, especially _Pop Group_ and _Sonic Youth_, are good references.

The whole album makes up one hour, 40 minutes. Naturally, not every single _jam_ is excellent. But tracks "Part II, IV" (**V.O.M. V**) and "Part I, IV" (**V.O.M. IV**) will give you a good idea about the **Magical Unicellular Music** sound. If you dig these, you will love the album!
