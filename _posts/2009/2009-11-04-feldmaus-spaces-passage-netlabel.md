***Charming Melodic Ambient*** // In general it's [Sven Swift]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about#sven-swift)'s part to introduce you to the world of [creative commons]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/creative-commons-music) ambient music. But where Sven gets crazy about experimental tunes, I still love the classic ambient tunes. And this is what "Spaces" by Feldmaus is about. Colourful and melodic ambient floating like water. It's like a trip to a peaceful surrealistic world.

Passage Netlabel is an ambient sub-division of [Fragment Music netlabel](http://www.fragmentmusic.net) established in 2009. While the russians deliver HiFi-Minimal Techno and similiar tracks on Fragment Music _the main course of Passage is to explore the deepest and most charming forms of abstract musical expression_. Passage is handling flexible style borders with several main settings - flowing ambience, organic structure and depth.

/images/feldmaus.gif"Feldmaus is a collaboration between Evgeny Shchukin and Alexander Tochilkin both known as [Modul]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/idm/715-free-idm-electronica-download-on-phonocake-netlabel). The title of their album describes best what the music is about: spaces where you find musical ambience in each corner.

Starting off slowly and subtle with "Sunbeams In High Grass" and "Lively Inner Shore" you will listen to ambient music with a subtle 4-to-the-floor kickdrum like a pulsating heart. In one of those tracks Japanese guitarist Imachi Akira joined with Feldmaus to build a fantastic trip through space and time in track called "The Sky Turned (feat. Imachi Akira)".

**A beautiful, relaxed and cinematic adventure.**
