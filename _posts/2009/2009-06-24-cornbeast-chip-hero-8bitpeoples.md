***Gameboy Arena Rock*** // We haven't had much chip music lately, and I used to check the usual sources of 8bit music less frequent than I did back in the days. "Chip Hero" by Stockholm Gameboy programmer Fredrik Stolpe, however,  is one of the more recent releases at 8bitpeoples, and it hit me hard.

In a way, Cornbeast suits the recent trends in Discorock and punky Electronica quite well. Catchy melodies, uplifting beats, rough sounds. So far, this is true for a lot of chip music releases. But Cornbeast's "<a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography/by/cornbeast" target="_blank">Chip Hero</a>" brings along more than just 20 minutes dancefloor energy. Below his bleepy textures, _gameboy_ Fredrik hides well-written songs with melodies that make stick and do not solely work by making you remember your Nintendo handheld.

This is the case especially for "Megablast", "Chip Hero" and the _ballad_ "Sparks". _Soulwax_ meets _Daft Punk_ in a 8bit outfit? Gameboy Arena Rock? Probably said too much, but you get the idea. Recommended.
