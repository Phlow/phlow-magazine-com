_Whoops, there it is!_ [We told you]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/interview-portrait/816-talkinbout-beats-with-error-broadcast) about this one coming up and finally it's there. A damn fine Netlabel for delicious Instrumental Hip Hop Beats: Error Broadcast. Get ready for some steamin', deep brazzling tracks.<!--more-->

And how netlabels like to kick it off, Error Broadcast makes no exception: A compilation to introduce you to the Hip Hop world of  Error-Broadcast with music by [Comfort Fit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tag/comfort-fit), [Apes On Tapes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tag/apes-on-tapes), B-Ju or [Niteffect]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tag/niteffect).

There are many netlabels out there! But why are there so few netlabels which care about broken beats. Where are all these Hip Hop and Drum'n'Bass netlabels? Fortunately our dear Sven Swift teamed up with Filippo Aldovini. If you thought those boys already had enough to run their netlabels <a href="http://12rec.net" target="_blank">12rec.net</a> and <a href="http://www.zymogen.net/" target="_blank">Zymogen</a> the present tells you, you've been wrong.

Luckily as I am I had a chance to listen to the freshly released compilation already some months ago. And the fortune is coming now to you. I hope you will enjoy these Hip Hop anthems as much as I do. Check out melodic movers like "Rock da Dam feat. Portformat" or "Die Faultiere". Or drop some experimental tracks like "Out for a Shrink Pink Drink" from Apes On Tapes into the inbox of your mp3-player.

And don't miss the leading track on this Hip Hop compilation by B-Ju: "Philly Run".

This is truly _"a compilation of contemporary Hip Hop: experimental, edgy and kicking"._
