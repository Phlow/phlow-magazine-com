***Far-Out Beats*** // E.T. getting _weededed_? Starship Enterprise floating above a field of ripely Marihuana shrubs? All this hand drawn and arranged in flashy colour in front of a space backdrop? The art on Raleigh Moncrief's enigmatic "Combed Over Chrome EP" did not made me hit the download button immediately but from the first noises I heard I was sure: this one is a doozie. And eventually, the artwork ain't too bad.

Ah c'mon! I can't find out ANYTHING about neither "**Raleigh Moncrief**" nor the remixers (?) "Chandeliers" and "Dash!". <a href="http://obstructivevibe.com/" target="_blank">Obstructive Vibrations</a>, please! Moncrief is from Cali, is he? Everything I got is the private Myspace of designer <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brandon_k" target="_blank">Brandon Kalarney</a> and these five tunes...

Well. "**Combed Over Chrome**" is massive. Spliffed-out and dirty. Fresh and experimental, yet catchy and compatible with any Hip Hop and Dubstep dancefloor. <a href="http://astro-nautico.blogspot.com/2009/10/raleigh-moncrief-free-ep.html" target="_blank">Astro Nautico</a>, well-informed source for Bay Area Rap as usual, says _"Hudson Mohawke and Matthew David had a baby and named him Raleigh Moncrief"_, and that's a good comparison indeed.

All five tracks are dope. While "Combed Over Chrome" features heavy beats and glittering synth arpreggios, "Goldrush (Chandeliers Remix)" focuses on IDM-ish melodies and baaad ass bass. With "Similies", **Raleigh Moncrief** fuses wobble-wobble Dubstep with an Old School Hip Hop beat and Mohawkesque synth leads. Timeless. Eventually, "Quiet Please" closes the chromo dance with a deep 'n' dirty piece of solanaceous Dubstep that equally sounds L.A. and London. OMG what a BOMB!
