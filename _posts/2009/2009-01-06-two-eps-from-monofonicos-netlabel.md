Like [yesterday]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/962-menuda-coincidencia-ai-con-permisito-delhotel-records) we visit once again South America and its rich music culture. This time we visit Colombia and the Monofónicos Netlabel. With actually two releases called "Colores: Fluidos" and  they set signs into the Techno-House direction. Clean synthesizer sounds await us thrown into the echo chamber of Dub.<!--more-->

While <a href="http://www.monofonicos.net/index.php/netlabel/lanzamientos/mns-001-va-colores-fluidos/" target="_blank">"Colores: Fluidos"</a> opens Monofónicos with a compilation to the public which represents five artists, Dsum makes the first steps as a solo artist with his <a href="http://www.monofonicos.net/index.php/netlabel/lanzamientos/mfn-001-dsum-libertad-ep/" target="_blank">"Libertad EP"</a>. Both EPs deliver melodic House-Chords accompanied with beautfilul easy swinging percussions. Sometimes you feel like dancing on the rainbow. Somehow I got the impression Dsum likes Thomas Fehlmann and his extraordinary TechHouse-Tunes...

Especially the sweet "Liberdad (Original Mix)" track floats with its analogue jazz bassline like the setting sun into the sea. Easy, man! If you like it a little bit darker, check out the remix by Rat with some playful clickering percussions for a deeper TechHouse-approach.

If you hop over to the compilation, you discover some deeper house tunes like "Sublime" and more airy and classic dubtechno tunes like "Bermuda".  "Colores: Fluidos" fits perfect to sunny afternoons sitting around with friends eager to start into a fun club night.
