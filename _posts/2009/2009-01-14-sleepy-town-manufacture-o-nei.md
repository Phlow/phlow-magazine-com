<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music-video/1014-sleepy-town-manufacture-o-nei" target="_blank"><strong>Beautiful handdrawn animated music video</strong></a> // This poetic video clip comes along with the netlabel compilation "Intelligent Toys 5" by Sutemos. It took three months to draw everything by hand for <a href="http://iliustracija.net/" target="_blank">no_joy</a>, the artist behind this beautiful piece of art.  The style of the video reminds me of old animated movies I saw in my youth coming from eastern europe. Fascinating about the clip is its richness of details. You can discover lots of hand-drawn characters flying, crawling and wandering through a vector-based world.
