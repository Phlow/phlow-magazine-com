modularfield is the rebirth of DCC Records from Cologne/Germany. "Bassment" is the first release to kick off the renamend netlabel. And PHVSR sets immediately the course of this techno spaceship: Groovy Minimal Techno. And PHVSR is definetely a good choice because you got some tricky sounds and rhythmic experiments with with this EP.<!--more-->

If you enjoy melodic and kicking Techno somewhere inbetween TechHouse and Minimal Techno than give PHVSR a listen. Check out the marvellous rhythmic change at the end of "schnittgrößen". Or enjoy how a techno-ravesignal turns out into some sort of field recording taken in the tube. "Metro" is tricky and enthusiastic. And than comes "percuss" a trancy groover with even more _frenetic raise-your-hands-into-the-sky-potential_. Let loose!

No Fillers on this EP. I really enjoy every track. So thumbs up for modularfield!
