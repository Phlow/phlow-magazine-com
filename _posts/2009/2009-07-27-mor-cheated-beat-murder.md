***Summer Bleeps*** // Some odd and new and unexpected music hits my ears from Itlay-born Antonio Rosselli. Unexpected because his six-track EP was published via my favourite _Weird Pop_ imprint Beat is Murder - and I was not aware that Dino, the gentleman behind the wheel of BiM, fancies releasing playful _Indietronics_ like this.

Sound engineer Antonio Rosselli appears under the moniker MoR (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/masterofribongia" target="_blank">Masters of Ribongia</a>), which is not too clever as this name was adapted by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/MOR" target="_blank">many others</a> before. Scroble your name before publishing it is the message! Anyway, just to avoid some confusion...

"I've cheated" is a very wonderful mixture of _Four Tet_-style Electronica and up-lifting, cheerful Chiptune-melodies. Something you can find with 12rec. recording artist <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/12rec.038" target="_blank">Rob Hunter</a> as well. What made me listen up this time is the influence from UK contemporary dance music - every now and then, Rosselli introduces abyssal Dubstep synthesizers and lets his beats stumble in a Garage/ 2step-style. This comes rough and dirty and beautifully mirrows the more gentle elements like chimes and acoustic guitars. Eclectic listen!
