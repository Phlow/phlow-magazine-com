***Video*** // [**"Seeds" by Candlestickmaker**]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/idm/829-candlestickmaker-seeds-upitup-netlabel) is one of my favorite IDM-albums of the past. His new follow-up called "A Life in a Day" isn't that much melodic, lollypop and colourful and I don't know yet, if I like it. Please [taste it yourself on Upitup](http://www.upitup.com/catalogue/release.php?cat_id=31).

But... The video for the song "Take Me Elsewhere" is just one thing: _**Incredible!**_

I can't get the impression out of my head, that Candlestickmaker cooperated here with some one from the demoscene - to be precise [icecream-xtruder](http://icecream-xtruder.com). If you are a collector as I am, be fast and download the original mpg-file coming along with the album (have a look into the txt-file).
