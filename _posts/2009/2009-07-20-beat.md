If you are not familiar with the traditions of beat tapes, let me give you a brief introduction. Producers publish beat tapes to introduces themselves to the scene and pave the way for possible cooperations. **Usually, these tapes are collections of _beats_ rather than perfectly produced _songs_.** Typical beat tapes show a variety of styles in maybe 20 different skits, each lasting one to two minutes. The best-known beat tapes are "Donuts" by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jdilla" target="_blank">J Dilla</a> (I mean, face it) and the "Rap Beats Vol. 1" CDR by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/samiyambeats" target="_blank">Samiyam</a>.

His tapes "<a href="http://www.kwatro.info/tagged/First_Spaceshit_On_The_Moon" target="_blank">The First Space Shit on the Moon</a>" was published via the <a href="http://www.kwatro.info/" target="_blank">Kwatro</a> collective and features 30 sketches of warm and semi-electronic Rap beats. His tape is highly musical, razor sharp and sounds pretty much _now_. Definitive must-have, kids!

This funky guy released his soulful tape "<a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=163059138&blogId=493715740" target="_blank">1080 Beats</a>" via myspace just recently, and it's really worth a listen. Dusty-jazzy beats and samples set Hi-Res apart from most producers in the game and save the kid a top ranking in the _Post-Dilla_ charts. So clap your hands to what he's doing.

Elaquent is working with vocal samples and cut-up Rap vocals that made people compare him to _Prefuse73_. Maybe the most underground, most rough tape in this collection.
