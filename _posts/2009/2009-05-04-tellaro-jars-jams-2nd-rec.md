***Leftfield Pop that has seen it all*** // This record has been sleeping on my HD for quite a while- well, sleeping is not the accurate description. It has been running on heavy rotation actually. But I never made it for a proper review. But now! Lovers of leftfield Pop, ca. _Beta Band_ and _Books_, don't miss this gem.

[2nd rec](http://www.2ndrec.com/blog/) is a German record label that released CDs some years back. When sales went down, [2nd rec](http://www.2ndrec.com/blog/) decided to sell-out and re-start as an experimental online label. "[Jars, Jams & You](http://www.2ndrec.com/034/)" by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Italian</span> Sicilian duo [Tellaro](http://www.myspace.com/tellaro) is available for download only, and you can choose the price, including downloading the full-length album for free. **We support [2nd rec](http://www.2ndrec.com/blog/) and want to convince you to pay something valuable for this wonderful record.**

[Tellaro](http://www.myspace.com/tellaro) are Francesco Cantone and Tazio Iacobacci. Their electronic Pop music is build from a billion sources, like a beautiful Frankenstein patched up from the junkyard of 40 years' pop culture. The download package comes with a 17 sides pdf booklets including notes for every song, charming and interesting. We learn about friends making political speeches, grandmother and baby sister Iacobacci singing a song, Tazio's uncle from the US playing slide guitar, etc. etc. Most contributions include vocal performances, not necessarily singing though.

Wonderfully, **all this makes up for a fresh, interesting and hymnal Pop record.** Clever Pop music, notoriously underrated, in good tradition with acts like _The Books_, _The Beta Band_, _Evil Superstars_ or the _Anticon_ posse. [Prelisten](http://www.2ndrec.com/034/listen.html) tracks "Dario Whorenges", "Life Goes On" and "Bad News Don't Need To Be Introduced" to become a believer. Then, believe it, every single tune on "[Jars, Jams & You](http://www.2ndrec.com/034/)" will be worth the bucks you spend for the download!
