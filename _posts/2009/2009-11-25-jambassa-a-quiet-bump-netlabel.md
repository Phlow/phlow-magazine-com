***Digital Dub Voices*** // With "macchine parlanti" the superb italian netlabel A Quiet Bump strikes back. Behind the music project Jambassa operate Carmine Minichiello and Raffaele Gargiulo. Being part of the label crew they now seed their second album. The sound of their digital dub project from the south of Italy is a combination of cold digital sounds, a warm hugging bassline and vocals by joining artists.

Next to Jahtari the Italian _A Quiet Bump Netlabel_ is a constant source of delicate dub anthems. What I like about the Jambassa sound is the curiosity and intelligence with which Carmine Minichiello and Raffaele Gargiulo build their rhythm-driven riddims.

On top seven different artists chant and sing over the grooves from Italy. That makes this album unique and entertaining. Just listen to "like silence" featuring Ltd. Candy and compare it to "combo combo thing" featuring Reddog and Boom Buzz. While Ltd. Candy seduces you with a sexy voice Reddog and Boom Buzz take the train to Zion.

**Jambassa sound unique, deep and rhythmic. Big up to Italy!**
