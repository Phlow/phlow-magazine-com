***One-Song-Feature*** // OK, Today I have to share only one song with you: "Possibilities". I found the track on the average compilation "apegenine volume two" released by the apegenine Label. "Possibilities" from Henrik Jose totally blows me away with its pop-appeal, idm-ish sounds and a beautiful voice. Since I discoverd Henrik Jose on the ["Cycles" compilation by Camomille]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/electronica-indietronic/241-va-cycles-camomille-netlabel) I am a huge fan.

I truly love this slightly pathetic voice of Henrik Jose. I adore these little electronic experiments with sounds. And I simply get hooked by the frenetic flavor of "Possibilies". It's warm, enthusiastic and beautiful. It made my day.

The whole compilation called "hypocondriac" doesn't work for me in general. I skipped a lot of the tracks. To many different styles, sometimes to dark, sometimes just boring. There are only two more interesting songs to mention. One is called "jesus was a b-boy (makunouchi bento remix)" which is heavily inspired by the sound of [Burnt Friedmann](http://www.burntfriedman.com/). It's a playful spoken-word-hip-hop-track. And give a listen to "koi"by Kyle Dawkins a simple but warm electronica track.
