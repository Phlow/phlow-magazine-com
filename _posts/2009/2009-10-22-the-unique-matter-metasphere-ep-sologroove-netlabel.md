"Dejaview Watchers" is one of those groovy Techno Dub tracks where you sit on an ice rock drifting through a cold, wide and abstract world. With "Metasphera" you glide on a spaceship through a progressive house world meeting natives from the Psytrance Movement. "New Suite" introduces you to your new minimal techno sci-fi apartment. And "Structured Abstractions" is the slightly mysterious cellar, where all the machines calculate the artificial world you just visited.<!--more-->

The Unique Matter delivers you with four tracks an insight of the russian soul of techno. My favorite track is "Dejaview Watchers", I just enjoy dubby techno from time to time. It's just a perfect sound to surf through the web. But the excellent fact of this EP remains: All tracks come with a different approach and give you an excellent release to use as a dj as well as enjoying it at home or your mp3 player.

_"Douze points, russie!"_
