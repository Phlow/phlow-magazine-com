For quite a long time, Arcoplane went below my radar. The label is around since 2003, but only due to the advice of my dear friend Ian Hawgood I follow them now. Londons' Red Box Recorder represent the label sound perfectly and deliver a mature album with superb artwork.

You know, I'm a sucker for elaborate artwork. In case of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djparticlefusion" target="_blank">Red Box Recorder</a>s' second album "Colour Codes", the frontcover made me download the record <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">blindly</span> deafly. Once unpacked I was delighted to find a PDF with a lot more wonderful images... Thumbs up for the man <a href="http://maxmclaughlin.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Max McLaughlin</a>, who is some sort of in-house designer at Acroplane. Take a look:

But hey - **I would not write this if the music didn't kick me at all!** Red Box Recorder (aka "DJ Particle Fusion", lol) came a long way, picking the best from Drum & Bass, Hip Hop, Downbeat and Soul music. The outcome, however, is difficult to categorize.

There is a wealth of instruments used, and they mix beautifully with the complex beat patterns. Some tunes recall older _Ninja Tunes_ records, some feature influences from UK breakbeat more clearly. Programmings are always soulful and performed with a good sense of musicality. I had to think of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/idm/1066-koen-park-84-85-acroplane" target="_self">Koen Park</a> and Resynthsize every now and then. "Colour Codes" is a bit too long to be without a spot, but a lot of goodness can be found in here!
