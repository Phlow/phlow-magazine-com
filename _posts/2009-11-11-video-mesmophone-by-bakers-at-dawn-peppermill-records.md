***Video*** // More and more netlabels experiment with video clips and make their own productions more _visible_. A new netlabel joining the video club is Peppermill Records. For the album "You Must Hide Your Love Forever" by Bakers at Dawn they offer now "a simple but nice" clip for the song called:

[Bakers at Dawn - "Mesmophone" (MP3)](http://storage.peppermillrecords.com/bakersatdawn/05-Bakers_At_Dawn-Mesmophone.mp3)

The video is a blurry, super-8-inspired beautiful clip and also available in high definition. Enjoy it in our [Phlow Vimeo Channel](http://vimeo.com/channels/phlowtv#7426834) and **give it a hug via click on the heart!** As usual the whole album ["You Must Hide Your Love Forever" by Bakers at Dawn](http://www.peppermillrecords.com/pm013/) is available as a free download released under [creative commons licence]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/creative-commons-music).
