The artworks from <a title="one!man" href="http://www.ideology.de/archives/artists000013.php" target="_blank">one!man</a> are still stunning to me after all his years over at <a href="http://ideology.de" target="_blank">ideology.de</a>. Each of his cover-artworks were composed in Photoshop only. Accurance, a faible for details, structures and unique colors are part and parcel of his visual and futuristic works. Have a look!

While his artwork for Cuebism is full of humour - the man in the picture is his father - most of his designs look futuristic. One of my favorite artworks is for Oddjobs Ambient Album. In the picture you see beautiful ornamental structures. But don't make the mistake to think, you see just one pattern. Wrong! Every ornament was composed with care and was placed individually at its own place. Art how it should be: Full of love for details.
