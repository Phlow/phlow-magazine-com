***Melodic Dub*** // With his "Dub Culture"-Single Echo\_TM provides Offbeat-Lovers with a real groovy and dubby anthem. While the bassline rolls warm on the floor, melodic vocoder-vocals grab your attention. In germany, we call those intense and pop-orientated tunes an "Ohrwurm", which means hard-translated: worm in the ear. It's difficult to get rid off an "Ohrwurm"-Tune, because you discover yourself whistling and humming the melody again and again... Echo\_TM knows how to produce such melodies...

"Dub Culture" is a classic single with an intro and two remixes. The title-track itself is just great material to remix and both version "T" and "M" are a welcome offer to let the Ohrwurm crawl back into your ears.

**A great "Ohrwurm" for late summer afternoons where warm sunrays warm our skin.**
