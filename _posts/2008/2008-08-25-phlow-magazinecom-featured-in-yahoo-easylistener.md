***Some excitement*** // Sometimes small things make my day: Today it was the discovery that Phlow-Magazine.com is featured with our music in the Easylistener-Music-Player published by Yahoo! when you come to the original <a href="http://next.yahoo.net/archives/32/easylistener" target="_blank">Easylistener website</a>. Just click on the tiny little button as you see it in our screenshot and you'll see - we're there :)

"Easylistener is a Flash music player which can literally play any page on the web. Simply point it at your favorite music blog, RSS feed or playlist document and it will crawl that URL and start playing back any mp3s it finds." I guess <a href="http://gonze.com" target="_blank">Lucas Gonze</a> has something to do with it, because he mentioned several times our little magazine. Thank you Lucas for some publicity!
