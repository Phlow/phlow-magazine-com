[Muhr](http://www.muhrmusic.com/) was around when the whole Netaudio thing initially kicked off.

Actually, Vince is the face behind the respectable <a href="http://camomille.genshimedia.com/" target="_blank">Camomille</a> Netlabel and <a href="http://www.apegenine.com/" target="_blank">Apegenine</a> recordlabel.
