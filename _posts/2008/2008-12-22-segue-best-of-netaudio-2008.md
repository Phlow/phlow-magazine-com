***Advent Calendar Door 17*** // segue is Jordan Sauer from Vancouver, Canada, currently residing in Washington DC. His music is a patchwork of textures and tones with a focus on the interplay of timbre. These sounds are created through the blending of various instruments, found sounds and field recordings. Jordan has numerous releases on netlabels such as Autoplate ([Thinner](http://www.thinner.cc)),  [Resting Bell](http://www.restingbell.net/), and his own [duckbay.net](http://www.duckbay.net/). Being a lover of all music, his approach to music and sound  is constantly evolving. Future projects include collaborations with [Pleq]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/386-pleq-songs-of-sens-and-nonsens-envizagae-records), IJO, [Ian (D.) Hawgood]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/555-man-of-taste-ian-d-hawgood-koen-park) and many others; a full length cdr release will be out on [Slow Flow Records](http://slowflowrec.web.fc2.com) sometime in 2009.<!--more-->
