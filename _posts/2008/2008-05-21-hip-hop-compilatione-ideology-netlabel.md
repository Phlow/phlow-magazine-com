With “Because Best Things Are Free” Ideology Netlabel delivers a heavy and delicate compilation. Next to amusing german rhymes, laid-back Hip Hop-instrumentals twinkle in the afternoon sun. Next to well-known netaudio-artists like [Comfort Fit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/dj-mix/277-comfort-fit-yellow-snow-mix "Free MP3 Music Downloads"), [Gringo Starr]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/dub-reggae/48-fleur-earth-w-gringo-starr-brennen-euch-ab "Free MP3 Music Downloads") and the freaks from the [Colonius Monk Collective]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/52-various-artists-colonius-monk-collective-ii-ideology "Free MP3 Music Downloads") you listen to new heroes like Niwa or Pestopan.<!--more-->

I have to admit, that Ideology Netlabel distributes some of the best downbeat and hip hop-instrumentals in the last couple of months. Alternative and skillful productions lift this compilation up and make it one of my favorite samplers this month.

What's amazing about this little diamond, is the fact, that we stumble upon disco-inspired tracks like "When she looked at me (i saw her wondering)" from Niwa into techy Hip Hop-Beats produced by Comfort Fit. But wait, there are some real stompers round the corner: After we left the "Time Machine" we walk through a city full of noise. While the jackhammer pumps, Pestopan lets his smiling monster-track "Clgn Sght Hrng" loose.

Five Stars, lots of medals and "Thank You's!" to the musicians for this delicate Hip Hop package!
