***Dark Beats*** // DJ Side goes down with the bass while his beats creep heavy-burdened over the floor. His ["Bittersweet Love EP"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/533-dj-side-bittersweet-love-ep-surreal-madrid-netlabel "Free MP3 Music Downloads") is a gloomy trip where dubstep meets ambient meets clicks, crackles and slowly breathing sounds. With mesmerizing and minimal changes in his sound aesthetics he develops a hypnotic maelstrom.

"Bittersweet Love EP" is condensed dark atmosphere. I am fascinated by the minimal sound, which sucks you into the deep EP. With little sound elements, some small changes the czech producer creates a cinematic grimmy shortstory. Great stuff, ready to rewind!
