***Advent Calendar Door 19*** // **Jaume <span class="nfakPe">Muntsant</span>** was the first catalan guy I met related to netaudio (a catalan is someone who lives in Catalunya, a small country in  Spain). That was some years back in time, when he started publishing his minimal techno as **Hermético** on a homelabel named **Doblec**. Later he founded <a href="http://www.inoquo.com" target="_blank">inoQuo.com</a> with **Sr.Click** and **Dato**, which is, without any doubt,  one of the BIG spanish netlabels. You should check it out now and then if you're into minimal beats. Jaume also started a netaudio blog called <a href="http://www.oirparacreer.com" target="_blank">Oir Para Creer</a> some years ago and releases experimental dark ambient music under his **Nigul** alias. You can also find some of his jobs under the nickname <a href="http://www.op3n.net/op3n/002.php" target="_blank">Choplin</a>. As you see, this is another busy netaudio fellow to go in the pack.
