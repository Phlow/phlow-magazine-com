Yeah, Dope Beats ahoi! If you like groovy breakbeats, we have some candy for your ears. With Suhohvs melodic “Symphaty Modul EP” you get lots of strings, cut-up vocals and excellent sampled loops. Every song is carefully put together to kidnap you for a marvellous organised robbery. I guess Suhov is a true vinyl-nerd with a huge collection of rare grooves, jazz and funk.<!--more-->

Start the track "Exx Fuck" by Suhov and this smart EP sucks you immediately into the music. Suhov opens his music-library and like in the old days of Hip Hop, he samples what sounds great and fits best. Take a flute from this record, combine it with that lively piano-hook and fatten the big beats...listen...yeah... definitely groovy!

But the best thing of all: Next to the delicious toppings I am happy, that I never haven't listened to all those samples before - fascinating. **This is killer material, searched with care and composed to present an amazing music release.**

If you like music by Mr. Scruff, Jazzanova, De-Phazz, Yonderboi or Propellerheads, this damn fine netlabel release by the young and promising [netlabel Budabeats]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/428-crookram-1976-budabeats "free mp3 music") is a must! To me, **release of the month**!
