***Gameboys & accordions*** // Mark Denardo managed to connect two of the most contrasting genres in the netlabelscene – chiptunes and singer/songwriter music. On his six-track ["Lion, Tiger, Bear"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/folk-acoustic/475-mark-denardo-lion-tiger-bear-8bitpeoples) EP, digital 8-bit sounds are being served with analogue instruments like acoustic guitar, piano, accordion, violin and lyrics that come along in a folk and blues-like style. This creative mixture is unique in its style and therefore, Mark Denardo’s music deserves its own label: chip-folk. <!--more-->

Mark Denardo grew up with playing different traditional instruments and at a certain age he rediscovered the gameboy. Since then the New York (Brooklyn)-based musician and composer treats the nostalgic plastic machine as a valuable musical instrument and connects familiar gameboy generated 8-bit sounds with traditional blues and folk music, which is especially transparent on his “[Lion, Tiger, Bear](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography/by/mark_denardo)” EP (listen to the songs “Grass”, “Fare” and “Muse”).

It is important to him to know how to use a technology to expand his horizons. So, using a gameboy is an evolution in composition to him. The way he creates his music is based on a [DIY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY)-attitude and spontaneous ideas that are being put on top of each other until there is something that can be called a song. Another fact that needs to be pointed out is that Mark Denardo joined the biggest chiptune conglomerate you can think of: 8bitpeoples. And that’s the place to be for an 8-bit-gourmet. If you want to know more about him, have a look at [this short potrait](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9cyebuqfCA) or see him live and in action [right here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOqXvJERWnw).
