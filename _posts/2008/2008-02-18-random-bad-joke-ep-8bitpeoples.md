***Delicious 8bit Cheese*** // Surfing 8bitpeoples.com is a bit like coming home. Not only the website didn't change for years, it's mainly because of the soothing/ uplifting retrofuture sound of their releases. Every single download brings forth the spirit of the 80's 8bit-consoles like the NES or the (in-) famous Nintendo Gameboy. [Random's "Bad Joke EP"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/chip-music/282-random-bad-joke-ep-8bitpeoples) is the most advisable in a series of recently published releases.<!--more-->

William Rickman a.k.a. Random is the great white hope of 8bit Pop. He's involved at the Stockholm epicenter of Chip music, [Mikrodisko](http://www.microdisko.net/ "Mikrodisko Website"), is personally involved at [8bitpeoples.com](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/ "8bitpeoples Website"), studies composition in London and travels the world for his [live performances](http://www.vimeo.com/602392 "Random @ Blip Festival 2006").

Like 8bit peoples [Bit Shifter](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php?artist=Bit%20Shifter#8BP059 "Bit Shifter @ 8bitpeoples.com") and [David Sugar](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php?artist=David%20Sugar#8BP060 "David Sugar @ 8bitpeoples.com"), Random creates vulgar melodious and catchy Pop music. For great effort, he combines a his talent for melodies with impellent House- and Rock-rhythms, strictly limited to the sound of the good old Gameboy. There's not too much intellectualism necessary to access his recordings, but everybody who has only the slightest sympathy for [chip music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_music) in particular and Pop in general should hurry and download this precious collection of 8bit chart breakers.
