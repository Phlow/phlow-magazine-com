[Krowley](http://www.myspace.com/polyc1 "Krowley @ myspace.com") is 17-years young producer Felix Trawöger. His EP "Four Pieces" is a fresh mixture of melodic, analog instrumentation and urban beats and synths that reminds me a lot of "Eve Future"-releases by _Kraftwerk_-heirs _Kreidler_ from Düsseldorf. With "I Saw My Lady Weep" Trawöger's EP starts bare naked with piano, spinet and viola. The whole song is a beautiful little piece of chamber music, it's contemporary origin only proven by minor hints. Second _bassedanza_ "Ayre" combines _Aphex Twin-_style beat patterns with field-recordings and an enjoyable offbeat guitar motive.

For "Cyre", Trawöger descends even further into Pop. The dense guitar instrumentation is left as slave to the mighty LFO-groove of a synth bass-line. You can hear simple drums, somewhere in the middle a flute is introduced. It's stunning to hear how seamless [Krowley](http://www.myspace.com/polyc1 "Krowley @ myspace.com")'s neo-Renaissance ideas accord to nowadays genres like IDM or Hip Hop. While last song "Pavane" (!) is a bit boring, "Cyre" is an awesome piece of left-field Electronica. Well done, kid.
