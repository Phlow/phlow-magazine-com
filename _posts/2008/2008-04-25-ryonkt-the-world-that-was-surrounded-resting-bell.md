***Japanese Ambient Benefaction*** // To readers of Phlow Magazine, Ryonkt ain't a new name. I wrote a review about his debut EP "[Slow Time]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/77-ryonkt-slow-time-ep-dog-eared-records)" in November 2007. Back then, Ryo Nakata aka Ryonkt promised to releases some more music in the near future. After appearances at [Audiotalaia](http://audiotalaia.blogspot.com/2008/01/at008-ryonkt.html "Ryonkt @ Audiotalaia"), [Mandorla](http://www.mandorla.com.mx/ "Mandorla Netlabel") and [Noise-Joy](http://www.noise-joy.org/artists/ryonkt.html "Ryonkt @ Noise-Joy"), Nakata delivers his most recent masterpiece via the welcome hands of Resting Bell Netlabel.<!--more-->

The four track EP is epically entitled "The World That was Surrounded by a Deep Forest and Warm Light". The artwork shows a vivid painting by [Karl Bodmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bodmer "Karl Bodmer @ Wikipedia"), a 1809 Swiss-born artist who traveled the "new world" portraiting the North American indigines and white folks settling the west. Alongside the highly figurative title and Bodmer's [moony paintings](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bodmer "Karl Bodmer Gallery @ Wikimedia"), you get a good idea of Ryonkt's music without having heard a single note.

Ambient guitar music, smooth in tone and rich in texture, this is what Ryonkt is known for. The overall warmth and sunlit harmony of his short-term meditations is striking at first try. Where "Slow Time" was lightly linked to Folk- and Pop music, "The World That was Surrounded" has a more experimental purpose; the fact that Nakata does not forget about certain harmonic and structural changes makes his music unique. Pick your favorite tune, they're all worth it.
