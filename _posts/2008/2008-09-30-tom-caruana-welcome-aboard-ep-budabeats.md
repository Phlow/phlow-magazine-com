While staring out of the airport window at Barcelona Airport returning home from netaudio.es Tom Caruana grabs me by the ears. And once again I am truly excited that I have discovered Budabeats by mistake. Since its appearance every release from [Suhov]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/603-suhov-sympathy-modul-ep-budabeats-netlabel "free downbeat music") to [Crookram]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/428-crookram-1976-budabeats "free hip hop music") convinced me: High Standards galore! And now british homeboy Tom Caruana crosses my ears...<!--more-->

"Welcome Aboard" is delicate mixture of different hip hop styles. Tom Caruana stands either in the tradition of mixed martial arts djs like Mr. Scruff throwing samples from crude and unknown records into the bowl. Mixing them up artisticly to make you smile about the sample-mosaic his presenting.

On the other side he follows the new british hip hop-movement led by people like The Streets. Like The Streets Tom Caruana amuses us with funny stories and a wide range of musical styles from DubStep inspired Hip Hop to funky and crackling tunes making your girlfriends love-handles swing.

No cheap tunes and drop outs on this EP. The only thing I like to complain: **This EP is definitely too short!**
