***Super-fat instrumental Hip Hop*** // Rap music is rare in Netaudio, and most of the stuff that runs ashore on my hard disc is bullshit. As exciting HipHop-releases are always a special joy for me, I was happy to discover [Equinox Records]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/254-va-one-year-a-day-the-5inch-files-equinox) releasing their "One Year & A Day"-compilation for free. Oil your necks for a whole bunch of promising new artists.<!--more-->

The Berlin HipHop-label is commonly known for it's beautiful vinyl-editions. Completely online (and completely free) is the latest joint by [Equinox Records](http://www.e-q-x.net "Equinox Records Website"): **a ten-track MP3 compilation with at least nine great bangers** from German producers. [Misantroph](http://www.misantropolis.de/ "Misantroph Website") drops a dark, super-fat track right between the eyes of _El-P_ and _DJ Shadow_, Aqua Luminus III. ([Komaflash](http://88komaflash.de/ "Komaflash Website")-collective) fuses fuzzy guitars, old-school cuts and [Def Jux](http://www.definitivejux.net/ "Def Jux Website")-style keyboards. [B-Ju](http://www.myspace.com/djbju "B-Ju @ Myspace") (Frankfurt) delivers an outstanding track that sounds like _Dabyre_ and _Diddy_ teamed up with a string quartet and, finally, [J. Baracuz](http://www.myspace.com/jbaracuz "J. Baracuz @ Myspace") (Berlin) is responsible for the _Dilla_-credits. Who ever tells you German Hip Hop can't cope the original- get him into this! So good.

PS: If you sign up for the EQX-newsletter, you will be able to purchase "One Year & A Day" as a strictly limited 5" vinyl-set later on.
