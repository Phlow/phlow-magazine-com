***Digital Phlow Podcast*** // Two weeks ago I met Patryk Galuszka for an interview about netaudio and netlabelism. Patryk Galuszka is a researcher who works for the <a href="http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/gaeste_en.asp" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies</a> and the <a href="http://www.wshe.lodz.pl/" target="_blank">Academy of Humanities and Economics in Lodz</a>. To find out more about Patryk visit <a href="http://pga.blox.pl/" target="_blank">his blog</a> and click the flag for a <a href="http://pga.blox.pl/strony/english.html" target="_blank">short English version</a>. **Or listen to our podcast and get to know some interesting facts about his research!** Last not least: If you are a netlabel owner and would like to make an interview with Patryk, than contact him and read on!

> About my research project: survey and interviews with representatives of netaudio scene. Aim: to learn more about netlabels, write scientific articles, promote the scene.
> 
> I am also looking for people from netlabels to conduct interviews with them (using Skype). If you have some time in December or January-February next year, let me know: patrykgaluszka [at] gmail.com (of course remove all the spaces and substitute [at] with @). The interview would last about 35-40 minutes. I guarantee anonymity (if you want). Thanks in advance!
