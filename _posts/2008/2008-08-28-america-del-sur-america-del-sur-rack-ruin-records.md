***Postpunk Teenage Surf Twang*** // There we go with a record very likely to enter my 2008 top ten! Rock-orientated Netaudio has become rather usual these days, but this precious lo-fi gem is something special. _Brian Wilson_-style vocal melodies, jazzy chords on guitars that sound like metal-rimmed glasses and a lot of (North) American Indiepop a la _Pavement_ is what these kids have to offer.<!--more-->

<!--adsense-->

America Del Sur ("America of the South") is basically <span class="standardtext">Phil Cardona and Taylor Ross. Friends from high school days back in Jacksonville, Florida, the band released their self titled debut at <a href="http://www.rackandruinrecords.com/">Rack & Ruin</a>, a Dutch Netlabel online since early 2008 but with a back catalog of +70 records already.</span>

<span class="standardtext">Here, number 64 is the one you definitely need to know. Cardona and Ross manage to mix angst-ridden Indierock ("Evil Pop") and sophisticated white boy Jazzpop ("I Don't Know You") like a duck takes to water. Their drums sound like shit, the guitars are tied just beneath the chin very probably. There <em>is</em> some Surf in there. But just like for recent NYC darlings <em>Vampire Weekend</em>, it's the fine vocal harmonies that keep the whole thing going- and America Del Sur at heavy rotation in my player. Ace.</span>
