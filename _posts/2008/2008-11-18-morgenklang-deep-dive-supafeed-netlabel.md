The Morgenklang-Duo know how to grab the knobs of their controllers to squeeze some cosy and smooth House Tunes out of the synthesizers and drummachines. Their sound on the House Netlabel Supafeed is relaxed and fits perfectly into cool lounges or into a laid-back dj-set.<!--more-->

With every of the three tracks you let dancers float into this self-reflective state of mind. This state of mind where everybody drifts in trance and smiles.

Morgenklang is german and means "sound of the morning". Maybe that's why all the tracks feel so fluffy and easy. Maybe Tobias Dziapko and Christian Tuchscherer try to catch that sweet feeling after a long night, where you slide exhausted but relaxed through the twilight. Excellent and harmonic old-school-house with some nice clicks.
