With his pounding basslines on his self-titled EP sabsidian aka sabian made already an impression on me. Back with one more track out of his lab, sabian is the one who rocks on the "Kapitel 1" EP-compilation on Konsum Productions. Next to his melodic drum'n'bass-groover Aguateca gets his weapons ready. His bad-stomper called "Stamp" knows how to kick ass. His bassline filtering give us a rough treatment and order: "Dance, mothafucka!".<!--more-->

German netlabel Konsum Productions distribute some really uplifting breaks. On this little four-track-compilation called "Kapitel 1" (chapter 1) **you find two excellent drum'n'bass-productions and two nice downbeat-tracks.**

While Aguateca and sabian are my weapons of choice for an uplifting dj-mix, PinoCchio SP and Hybreed cool you down with some groovy but too polite downbeats. Some edges or outstandig ideas are missing. But I don't mind, and dig the new sabian-track meanwhile. Sweet synth-strings, great rhode-grooves and a rollin' bassline. I need nothing more for a "Rhoooodeee-oooOOO!".
