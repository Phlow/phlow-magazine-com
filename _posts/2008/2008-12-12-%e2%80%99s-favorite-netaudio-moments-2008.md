***Advent Calendar Door 6*** // While trying to set the <a href="http://www.netaudio.es" target="_blank">netaudio.es</a> workteam we spread the word amongst friends mailing lists and social networks. David replied in just a few hours with an extensive mail, just after crossing some mountains nearby Russia. After reading the third line of we knew he was the guy. Having a look at <a href="http://daviddomingo.org" target="_blank">his website</a> will give you an idea of what i call **intense** activity... Heavily involved in organizing and producing lan parties and demoscene events around spain he talks about himself...<!--more-->

David quoting _sml! david:

> "David 'sml' Domingo has been musician, dj, producer, visual jockey, designer and event organizer in the last years.
  
> He's the co-director of netaudio.es and one of the main organizers of "netAudio Barcelona", the annual netaudio festival based in Barcelona (Spain).
  
> His long background in the demoscene took him to the netaudio scene as a logical evolution and now tries to promote the local scene with activities and collaborations."
