In 2002 he starded to produce different kinds of electronic music, from dub to electronica, dangerously sliding to the more experimental ways of electroacoustic. His world is made with sound fractures, nevralgic crepitations, melancolic atmospheres and a non-dissimulated fascination for rust and faded rhythms.<!--more-->

Diatribes, open ensemble, close to freejazz, with Cyril Bondi and guests, is his main improvised project.

## Netaudio Surprise 2008

> Well it's not really a surprise (at least I'd like to believe it) but the netaudio activists - as musicians, as netlabels manager, seems to extend more and more their actions out of the web, with festival, etc, I'm very glad of that.
