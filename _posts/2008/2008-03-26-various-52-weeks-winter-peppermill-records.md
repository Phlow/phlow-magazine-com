"52 Weeks" is an extraordinary project coordinated by Peppermill Records. The compilation includes 52 tracks representing each week of the year. The whole compilation is separated into four sub-compilations with the names of the four seasons of a year. I picked out the winter-collection because I enjoy sometimes music-collages with lots of samples and fine breakbeats. And the "Winter"-compilation - where the whole project started with - is a fabolous mix of Hip Hop and experimental downbeats fused together into a heavy mix.<!--more-->

If your ears are thirsty for some heavy Hip Hop-beats plus intelligent raps "52 Weeks - Winter" is a good choice to explore some new songs. Like a Hip Hop-mixtape beats, rhymes and effects are melted together. This was possible because the heads behind Peppermill Records coordinated the compilation with care and an interesting approach:

> The first artist started on the 21st of December, the first day of Winter which also happens to be the Solstice. They borrowed a headline out of that week's news as the title to their 2-3 minute song and then had 7 days to complete it before they passed their creation on to the next artist, who continued where they had left off.

So just lend your ear for example Cactus On Fire feat. Baba Brinkman. Nice Phlow, thick groove! Or listen to the funny opener with a ton of samples build around an abstruse news-story: "Squishing Sniffy - Artists Busted!". Or are you ready for some mad sarcastic electro, than listen to the wild "Third Armrest Betrays Alien Origin Of New Military Plane" by Gangpol & Mit. Fun!

**A fat, fantastic and fabulous release! You gotta dig this!**
