***A Careful Re-Design of a Netlabel*** // In the last two weeks I worked on the re-design for the german techno (net)label <a href="http://Broque.de" target="_blank">Broque.de</a> that sometimes also releases [alternative electronic music](http://phlow.net/magazin/mp3-musik-download/elektronisch/downbeat-dub/216-nils-hoffmann-broque-netlabel "Free MP3 Music ").

After some discussions in the beginning of the now gone summer, labelhead Christian Kausch assigned me to move to the next step: To re-design, program and set up a fully functioning content management system (<a href="http://WordPress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>) with some new delicious features. Today we lift the curtain and present you not only a re-worked and carefully crafted website... No, on top you get a new and funky techno-release from Russia.

I am sure, there are still some bugs left... And of course t**here are still some questions waiting for answers**:

  * Does the netlabel-website serve all of your needs?
  * What do you think is missing?
  * Do you need more functionality, more Web 2.0-features or are you satisfied?
  * What elements do you miss and what makes the perfect netlabel-website?

If you help us, maybe in the next months I will present you the ultimate WordPress-Theme to build a great music-website! So check it out, come back and **help us to build a concept for the perfect netlabel!**
