***Chillout Music for Spacenights*** // Years ago we always watched the stars and planet earth from above on TV when we came back from parties. Each weekend the [tv-station HR3](http://www.br-online.de/wissen-bildung/spacenight/) transmitted finest chill out and ambient music two sweeten our early morning hours. While our feet felt heavy from dancing, our soul rested on calm beats to drift away. If I listen to music from [Crisopa]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/270-crisopa-medicamentosa-addsensor) from [Madrid/Spain](http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&hl=de&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Madrid%2FSpain&ie=UTF8&ll=40.446947,-3.691406&spn=47.599473,92.8125&z=4&iwloc=addr&om=0) all these nice and relaxed pictures return.<!--more-->

"Medicamentosa" is somewhere inbetween ambient and electronic downbeats. addSenor recommends Crisopa's music productions "in a therapeutic level by professionals, in order to balance all the unhealthy situations nowadays." I simply agree but you won't need any therapists. Just turn on your hifi-amplifier and let's sweep all those dark and heavy thoughts away. This spherical and spaced out electronica will give you a rest, not forever but for a short time.
