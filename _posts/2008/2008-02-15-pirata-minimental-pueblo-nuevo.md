***Spherical Electronic Spacetrip*** // You can describe music by pirata best if you compare him with the well-known label Elektrolux. Like many artists and releases on Elektrolux Pirata produces a [spherical and spacy]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/idm/308-pirata-minimental-pueblo-nuevo) kind of music somewhere inbetween IDM, Elektro and Ambient. His electronic productions sound precise and clear. "Minimental" has a clear and very digital sound aesthetic. It's an album full of complex and tricky beats.<!--more-->

<!--adsense-->

Pirata is coming from Chile and releases his full electronic productions on the Pubelo Nuevo netlabel. His sound has its own trademark and takes you on a trip through electronic music and Piratas own definition of Elektro. An album that works alltogether. Respect!
