***Electric Krautrock*** // I'm into Tomorrowland since I first started listening to free music. Their 2001 EP "[Variable](http://www.archive.org/details/ramp316 "Tomorrowland @ archive.org")" is online at archive.org and still a good listen. Just recently, I found the follow-up album "Anemone" being released by their label [Red Antenna](http://www.redantenna.tv/ "Red Antenna Collective") for free, too. Take some time and learn to love their brusk melodies and grooves.<!--more-->

Tomorrowland is basically Stephen Baker and Nick Brackney, joined by Eric Morrison (of [Füxa](http://www.myspace.com/fuxamusic "Füxa @ Myspace")-fame!) on drums for the recording of "Anemone". Hailing from Michigan, USA, Tomorrowland had an album out at [Kranky](http://www.kranky.net/artists/tomorrowland.html "Tomorrowland @ Kranky") before they teamed up with NYC's [Red Antenna](http://www.redantenna.tv/ "Red Antenna Collective"). Both Baker and Brackney play their guitars through various effect pedals so one might assume there aint guitars _at all_. With Morrison's loop-a-like drum patterns and a few drum machine-dubs, the songs are really composed for minimal effort. But although the sound is very pure, maybe even paltry here and there, something happens between bubbling guitars, delay and drum tracks.

[Krautrock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraut_rock "Krautrock @ Wikipedia") is the magic word, and if you ever heard the first two _Neu!_ records or _Tortoise_'s "Millions Living"-album, you probably can imagine what I mean. Tomorrowland-tunes like "Mineral" and "Anemone" are growers for groove and melody, in a straight Rother/ Roedelius/ Moebius-kinda way. These songs have sort of a retro-feel while tracks "Stormy" and "Unfadeable" come up with increased density and volume, clearly locating Tomorrowland into US Postrock with references to [SST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records "SST @ Wikipedia"), [Thrill Jockey](http://www.thrilljockey.com/ "Thrill Jockey Website") and, well, [Kranky](http://www.kranky.net/ "Kranky Website").
