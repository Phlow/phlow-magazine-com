**Ambient Music Marching Band** ** I found out about Kaboom Karavan when listening to [d'incise's free music-charts]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/charts/172-dincise-free-music-charts-2007 "d'incise Free Music Charts 2007") we had published in December 2007 as part of the Netaudio Adventcalender. His choice of Folk-influenced electronic music is stunning, and the Belgian Kaboom Karavan-collective was totally new to me. Fortunately, the full-length record keeps the promise a single tune made up.<!--more-->

Kaboom Karavan is mainly Bram Bosteels. For his adventurous Free Folk music, Bosteels regularly gets together with his friends, situated in "a very small town in a rather small country", like he notes on [his myspace account](http://www.myspace.com/kaboomkaravan "Kaboom Karavan @ Myspace"). Sounds pretty much like a collective-thing going on, and if you take the open structure of his songs, the high amount of processing and all these jingle bells in account, a certain esoterism-charge might be appropriate.

But Kaboom Karavan have good songs. "Karavanserai", "No More Karavan" and especially "Short Walk with Olaf" are awesomely loose pieces of Blues- and Americana-influenced Post Pop, "Roadmap" is a brilliant composition of ambient and fractal Folk-pickings. After all, "Toambertree", with it's electronic basement more evident, manages to join Free Folk and aggressive Breakbeats surprisingly well. Carefully produced, this album would have been a good hit for [Kranky](http://www.kranky.net/ "Kranky Records Website") or [Constellation](http://www.cstrecords.com/ "Constellation Records Website") records. Hooray we get it for free via [Umor Rex](http://www.umor-rex.net "Umor Records Website")!
