***Interview at Netaudio London 2008*** // Really good Hip Hop Music is still hard to find in the creative commons world of music. If you search for netlabels promoting deep Hip Hop Music you have to stick to a baby-handful of netlabels. But there's a glowing light at the end of the tunnel. This torch is held by Filippo Aldovini from Zymogen Netlabel and well-known Sven Swift.

Both music nerds teamed up to stem a heavy-weight bassloaded **netlabel called <a href="http://www.error-broadcast.com/" target="_blank">Error-Broadcast</a> for Instrumental Hip Hop**. At Netaudio London 2008 they gave the party crowd a first listen, distributed some exclusive Promo-CDs and were caught by mo. to speak out loud into the microphone. Enjoy a Podcast-Radio-Show with an **exclusive track** from the upcoming Error Broadcast Compilation which gives you a glimpse how deep Error Broadcast digs into the ground.
