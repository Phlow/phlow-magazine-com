***Indie Dance*** // Poni Republic striked again. The mexican Leftfield-Pop Netlabel has just released another flashing EP. "Homeless Hero" is a fresh and well produced indie-dance collage, that makes you think of the big ones in the electronic pop business. The big surprise is that Bufi, the man in charge, is only a 21 year old musician who made his debut on Poni Republic. <!--more-->

[Bufi](http://www.myspace.com/bufirolas) (Mateo Gonzalez Bufi) from Mexico City is not a typical laptop rocker. Allthough this is the first image that comes to ones mind, Bufis music is different from simple computer generated electropop. His indiedance has a lot to offer. The synthpop and electro funk elements as well as the catchy pop hooks let me think of [Daft Punk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk). And the fact that Mateo is studying classical guitar adds another level of substance to his electrifying sound. Bufis "[Homeless Hero EP](http://ponirepublic.blogspot.com/2008/04/bufi-homeless-hero-ep.html)" contains four playful songs that belong in your ears and on every dancefloor.
