***OK, we're back now!*** // Dear Listener... After a little "Sommerloch" (summer slump) where we planned some beautiful things for you, we roll out a fantastic autumn for you. Did you miss a new Phlow MP3 Collection?!? **Yeah, a new compilation is coming soon!** Do you wanna meet us? No problem! Just **come to Barcelona and London and enjoy some time with the Phlow Staff**. While mo. meets the free music movement in Barcelona at <a href="http://Netaudio.es" target="_blank">Netaudio.es</a>, Sven Swift will join the mini-tournee with mo.Â  to rock <a href="http://netaudiolondon.cc/blog" target="_blank">Netaudio London 2008</a>.

And - wish us luck - we hope to kick off our new netlabel platform soon, a place for netlabels to represent and do some serious promotion for their music! Whoops, and last not least, there is **our first anniversary coming up!** We never thought, our little magazine would get so much attention... Of course, we hoped so, but will we crack the 1000 podcast-listener-barrier till the end of this year??? I guess, with your help we have a true chance! Please help us pushing the netlabel-phenomenon forward, and make us one of your favorites!
