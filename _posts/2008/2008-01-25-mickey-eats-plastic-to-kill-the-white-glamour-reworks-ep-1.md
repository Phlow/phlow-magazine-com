***Eclectic Remix-Collection*** // I posted a [demand-note]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music-marketing-promotion/231-demand-note-bluermutt-decivilize-after-consumption) for the upcoming Bluermutt-album a few days ago. Well, I hope you don't think myself to be too much of a bore, but I have to mention that [Mickey Eats Plastic](http://www.mickeyeatsplastic.com/ "Mickey Eats Plastic Website") (which is 50% Bluermutt) have another not-to-miss record online. This time it's free. Come on, kill the white glamour!<!--more-->

Italian Postrockers _Giardini di Míro_ put online a [tiny remix-collection](http://www.giardinidimiro.com/wordpress/?p=103) that incorporates an edit by [Mickey Eats Plastic](http://www.mickeyeatsplastic.com/ "Mickey Eats Plastic Website"). I checked his website to see what's new and saw this beautiful EP popping up: remixes Mickey had constructed for a bunch of cool people in the last months plus two MEP-reworks. Every single one is subtle electric, with a chosen amount of Pop-appeal and _je ne sais quoi_ .

The [Ellul](http://www.myspace.com/ellulband "Ellul @ Myspace")-remix focuses on the Country-style vocals and adds a heart-rendering synthesizer melody, Vienna Chip Hop-mastermind [Dorian Concept](http://www.myspace.com/dorianconcept "Dorian Concept @ Myspace") ([watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdRP3dQ9QOM "Dorian Concept @ Youtube") this guy!) becomes even more electric and hip-moving. I'm also pretty found of [NAW](http://www.phoniq.net/ "NAW Website")'s remix of "Every April": Toronto-based Neil Wiernik shift the tune into something bizarrely grooving and mesmerizing. Very worth the download, not least because of the great artwork by [Matias Conduri](http://www.flickr.com/photos/matiascoduri).
