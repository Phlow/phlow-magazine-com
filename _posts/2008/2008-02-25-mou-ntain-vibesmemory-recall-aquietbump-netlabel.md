The Italian band mou published already two exciting TripHop EPs on the aquietbump netlabel. Both albums are filled with dense and atmospheric songs. Heavily influenced by Massive Attack the italian musicians emacipate themselves with their second album "memory recall".<!--more-->

While "###ntain vibes Ep" rocks on dark vibes, "memory recall" convinces the listener with a more dub-orientated approach.

As a lover of drum'n'bass-beats I dig deep into the spherical song "notte di luna" on "###ntain vibes" by mou. With drum'n'bass-patterns played by a real drummer, the song sends some shivers over my back. Especially I like the italian voice of the MC. Normally we are used to listen to english-speaking MCs...

...but listening to the italian frontman of mou and his word-phlow is a true little adventure. If you compare both EPs "memory recall" sounds fatter in its production and much more homogen. On the other hand "###ntain vibes" experiments more with different kinds of flavour from drum'n'bass to downbeats. Never mind, if the journey of mou continues like this, we maybe have our first netlabel-superband. **mou is great, atmospheric and they rock!** More of that sound please!
