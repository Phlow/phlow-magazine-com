***Experimental and Catchy Guitar Music*** // Fiktion is the moniker of Gustaf Erik Lundh from Gotheburg, the album "Morfint" his second LP for the Swedish Frukt Netlabel. On his website, you can find his debut "Gryning & Skymning" and three EPs, all of them recorded since late 2006. Definitive a man of quantity, Lundh's latest releases is a rich source for suckers of high [quality Indie Pop]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/electronica-indietronic/444-fiktion-morfint-frukt-records), too.<!--more-->

The [Fiktion](http://www.fiktion.nu/ "Fiktion Website") music is mainly based on warm guitar-chords, smooth bass-frequency synths and a handful of clicks & cuts. I hear a lot of [Americana](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=77:2958 "Americana @ allmusic.com") in his lugubrious slide guitar sighs, _Bonnie "Prince" Billy_ for example, or _Califone_ (listen to "Subjektiv" and "Mjukt, Varmt and Fiktivt"). Taken in account the harmonious luxury and sugary darkness, even _Chris Isaak_ works for comparison.

The way Lundh uses bass guitar and synthesizers brings a cool Dub-element to his already splendid Pop-tunes. In comparison to Americana or Alt. Country, [Fiktion](http://www.fiktion.nu/ "Fiktion Website") is what UK Grime to traditional Hip Hop is: a dark twin, a hardheaded bastard, something new. _Tortoise_ bassist Douglas McCombs (solo as _Brokeback_) is the only <span>kindred spirit I have in mind. Songs "Fågelfostret" or "Coopers Dröm" will convince you to believe me. Wonderful EP!</span>
