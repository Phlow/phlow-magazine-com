Yeeeee! I searched a long time to discover new drum’n’bass-sounds in the worldwide netlabel-cosmos. But instead of discovering Zardonic Recordings myself, they contacted Phlow and now we are pleased to present you a real diamond: a wonderful mixed up Drum’n’Bass Compilation called “Rare Grooves Vol. 1”. If you enjoy deep breakbeat-science, keep on reading!
<!--more-->

"Rare Grooves Vol. 1" has it all: Fine breakbeat-gunnery with mad and chopped up beats in "Deadwoods" by Ibunshi who not only digged Photek, but sampled him right away. But fortunately Ibunshi didn't copy Photeks groove, just sticked to his outstanding sound-design and turned it into something new.

Than listen to the epic "Float" by Soul Delay. Wooyay! Mad deep, wonderfull flute-sounds thrown in the reverb-echo-machine to build a cinematic trip par excellence!

Like the drum'n'bass-freaks over at <a href="{{ '/suche/?query=plainaudio' | absolute_url }}">Plainaudio</a> the producers at Zardonic Recordings play with beats, no simple tech-steppin' found on this compilations. It's about the Breaks, you know what I'm sayin!

And another star goes to the labelheads because they build a solid compilations reflecting different influences from dark, badass tracks like "The Yard" by Process or "Scornful Behavior" Kid Kryptic to more ambient and melodic grooves like "Your Soul Can Rest" from DJ Scape or "Walking Home" by Soulie.

**All three thumbs up for Zardonic Recordings!**
