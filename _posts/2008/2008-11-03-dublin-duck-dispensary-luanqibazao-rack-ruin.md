***Psychedlic Lo-fi Indiepop*** // Bobby Aherne aka Dublin Duck Dispensary is a young Ireland lad, "Luanqibazao" his sixth EP of snotty Indiepop psychedelia, the third for Rack & Ruin Netlabel. "Luanqibazao" is Chinese and means "a complete mess". A good descriptions for the music, indeed! Between Dada lyrics, lo-fi Pop and Plunderpunk, one man outfit Dublin Duck Dispensary populate his own cosy niche.<!--more-->

One thing I like a lot about demos, b-side compilations, live recordings, and, well, certain Netaudio releases is the fact that the music can be quite rough. Unhewn both in sound and songwriting, Dublin Duck Dispensary's  "Luanqibazao" is a good example for what pearls might easily be overseen upon flighty observation. **13 tracks and drafts for Popsongs to come, much excitement can be found in here.** 

"Bible Stories" is the demo version of an early _Arcade Fire_ tune, "Prestidigitation" features lopsided drums and a happy-sad synth melody that makes you think of Nicholas Thorburn's _Unicorns_ (a big guide very likely!). "I Smell The Blood" is a wonderful guitar-driven Popsong, "Brain Damage" a _Wire_-style assault of compressed Punk energy. Between a few dubby experiments, "The Death Threat" is another fine Indiepop song you might want to be familiar with. Did I mention the _Beta Band_ for comparison? _Stephen Malkmus_? Bobby Aherne's influences are legion, but alltogether he manages to make to sound fresh and unique.

Check this delicate live performance!
