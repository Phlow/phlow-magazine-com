***Bad News*** // Yesterday night I stumbled upon the Kikapu Netlabel-Website while correcting some links. I was simply horrified, discovering that Kikapu claimed its dead. These are always the moments, when I grab my head and think: "Shit! We lost some beautiful digital culture and there is no way back to get another glimpse at it." In the next moment I discovered that you still find lots of music on archive.org but that's only a drop in the ocean of sadness. We lost one of the oldest netlabels and it's fantastic website.
