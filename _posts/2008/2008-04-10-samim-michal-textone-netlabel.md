C3PO and R2-D2 on MDMA For lovers of Minimal-House & Techno Netlabel Textone is still a great ressource. Textone which died an unspectacular death some time ago has still one alter-ego left. 30 releases survived the crematorium in its hideaway at archive.org. One of my favorite releases is the funky "ripop ep" by Samim & Michal. The three-tracker sounds like little bleep- and clicker-sounds dance on a deep hopping bassdrum.<!--more-->

Samim & Michal produce music for robots who enjoy taking some time off. Mad of the dull and dumb works they normally do, they ecstatically dance to the glitter-bleep-click-mnml-house by Samim and Michal. And the DJ who saved their lives is our nice friend [C-3PO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO) and his little compagnion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" target="_self">R2-D2</a> from a galaxy 'round the corner. The crowd thanks them with lots of squeaking metal arms in the air.

"ripop" is a statement how funky Minimal-House and Techno can sound. To me, a netlabel-classic.
