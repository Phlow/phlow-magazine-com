While doing some research for the [Random]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/chip-music/282-random-bad-joke-ep-8bitpeoples)-review, I stumbled upon the expanded video accompany of the bygone [Blip Festivals](http://blipfestival.org/ "Blip Festival Website"). The festival is hosted and organized by New York City's finest [8bit Peoples](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/ "8bit Peoples Netlabel") Netlabel and gets together the world elite of chip sound since 2006 (not sure about that). Now, for the 2008s edition of Blip, the infamous [2Player Productions](http://www.2playerproductions.com/ "2Player Productions Website") made up an extremely professional and dedicated documentation of the whole 8bit scene, listed for the [SXSW Film Festival](http://2008.sxsw.com/film/screenings/film/F9224.html "Reformat the Planet @ SXSW Film Festival"): "Reformat the Planet". A good moment to introduce some key players.<!--more-->

First of all, check the trailer:



Wow! This is exactly the tool, a brewing subculture needs to gain attention from the mainstream. At least a greater audience in case you deny the term "mainstream". Awesomely well produced, funny, cool and informative. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the whole thing... Nevertheless, fingers crossed for the [SXSW](http://2008.sxsw.com/film/screenings/film/F9224.html "Reformat the Planet @ SXSW Film Festival") from the whole Phlow Mag crew!

While the [8bit Peoples](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/ "8bit Peoples Netlabel") provide the world with free music, [2Player Productions](http://www.2playerproductions.com/ "2Player Productions Website") stream music- and live-videos of the protagonists via vimeo.com (
  
- you already know the mash-up clip for [Anamanaguchi]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/music-video/323-video-sting-operation-for-anamanaguchi#anchor-323). I choose a couple of videos to give you an idea of the 2PP style, starting with [8bit Peoples](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/ "8bit Peoples Netlabel") mastermind Joshua Davis aka [Bit Shifter](http://bit.shifter.net/ "Bit Shifter Website"). Chip Cruise Ahoy!



I have mentioned [Random](http://random2k.wordpress.com/ "Random Website") in the introduction, here's a cool video of this young Swedish 8bit raver:



Most chip heads are solo artist, rocking the stage solely with Gameboy, C64 or MacBook. [The Depreciation Guild](http://www.inhergentlejaws.com/ "The Depreciation Guild Website") is a Rock band rather than the typical Electronica stage act. Some kind of NYC 8bit poster boys, actually. Skinny guys with rampage guitars and NES-keyboards, how does this work? Assure yourself right here.



Another special thing in the chip scene is being female. Here, Korea-born Haeyoung Kim aka [Bubblyfish](http://www.bubblyfish.com/ "Bubblyfish Website") is one of my favorite 8bit musicians. Her style is a bit more academic, less hedonistic than the average chip party outlet. Make sure to check her album at Burkhard Kerlin's [Retinascan](http://www.retinascan.de/phpshop/themes/kategorie/detail.php?artikelid=497&source=2 "Bubblyfish @ Retinascan")-label!



To make you book the tickets to New York City and fall in love with the chips finally, enjoy this powerful live performance of Jeremiah Johnson aka [Nullsleep](http://www.nullsleep.com/ "Nullsleep Website"). Another important [8bit Peoples](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/ "8bit Peoples Netlabel")-head, Johnson is the dark messiah of chip music. Striking stage presence combined with belief, [Nullsleep](http://www.nullsleep.com/ "Nullsleep Website") might be the one to read about in your favorite music magazines at first. The 2PP spring for the moving pictures:
