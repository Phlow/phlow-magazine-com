***IDM-Remix Project*** // The original song by Modul for this complex remix-project was released on Electrosound.ru. The melodic song "Complete" is a deep, sweet and slow-motion song with a catchy bleeping title-melody. It's IDM-Music in its best classic way.

Just digg deep into this song called "Complete" and check out the tricky shuffled Bad Comfort Remix or the warm melancholic and slowly drifting remix by Madstyle. Also interesting the Sm Remix using a piano for the melody instead of using bleeps.
