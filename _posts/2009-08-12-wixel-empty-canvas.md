***Epic Ambient*** // Wixel is the experimental Folk moniker of Wim Maesschalck. In 2009, after his epochal "Somewhere Between the Sun and the Moon" CD album, Wim started a project called "12 Records in 12 Month". On a monthly basis, Wim releases a new EP, each 20 -25 minutes in length. June is especially great.

I'm a keen fan of Belgian Wim Maesschalck's work and music since 2004. Starting as a solo outfit, <a href="http://www.slaapwelrecords.com/wixel/" target="_blank">Wixel</a> soon became a band with Wim as central songwriter. The latest Wixel CDs "Heart" and "<a href="http://www.slaapwelrecords.com/wixel/sunmoon/" target="_blank">Somewhere Between the Sun and the Moon</a>" in particular are **wonderful pieces of postmodernism Folk- and Avantgarde music** everyone should be familiar with.

2009 saw the launch of Wim's "<a href="http://www.slaapwelrecords.com/wixel/2009/" target="_blank">12 Records in 12 Month</a>" project. Up to now, six records are online for download via <a href="http://2009.bandcamp.com/album/wixel-an-emtpy-canvas" target="_blank">bandcamp</a>. You can choose what you want to pay for the MP3, including nothing, or you go for the limited edition CDRs available from [Slaapwel](http://www.slaapwelrecords.com/wixel/archive/) (the tiny record label Wim is running).

The June EP "<a href="http://2009.bandcamp.com/album/wixel-an-emtpy-canvas" target="_blank">An Empty Canvas</a>" is the preliminary highlight of the series. Wim discards the fragile Folk approach and delivers a dense piece of dim and orchestral Ambient, not too far from _Gas_, [Nest]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/28-nest-nest-ep-serein) or 1970's German Electronica like _Cluster_ or _Tangerine Dream_. Wim himself notes _Arvo Pärt_ and Dubstep for influence. Check "Skatebeats" and the massive "Bacterial" to get an idea.

What I like best about "<a href="http://2009.bandcamp.com/album/wixel-an-emtpy-canvas" target="_blank">An Empty Canvas</a>" is the multilayer sound. **A lot of dirt and noise twinkles through the washed-out textures and synthesizer patches, you can discover new aspects on every new listen.** The beats, however, could deserve some more elaboration. But taking in account the facts this record was programmed in a month, that is pretty OK I guess.
