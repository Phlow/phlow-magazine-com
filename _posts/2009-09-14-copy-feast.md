***Belgium Conference about Copyrights*** // Wow, this year, a lot is moving in the Creative Commons World. After our fantastic <a href="http://cologne-commons.de/" target="_blank">Cologne Commons</a> Happening, Belgium is the next place to stop by. From the 24th to 26th of September 2009 our dear friends from <a href="http://netwaves.org/" target="_blank">Netwaves</a> open the gates to [Copy Feast](http://netwaves.org/node/479) in the City Library of Leuven.<!--more-->

Netwaves describes Copy Feast as a three-day festival during which copyrights, and more specifically the copying of creative works is taken under consideration. Using music, film, debate and workshops the Copy Feast teaches the public that downloading and distributing certain works indeed can be done legally. The Copy Feast is a collaboration of the radio program "netwaves" (Radio Scorpio) and the City Library of Leuven (BE).
