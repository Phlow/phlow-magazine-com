**Sweet Elektropop** // Ladies and Gentlemen let me introduce you to some german-austrialian electropop in english. On "You Break My Heart, You Remixed It" the austrialian project Emily In Love meets her remixers. Especially Rupert Falsch from Berlin took the rendez-vous quite serious and starts a duet with Emily to express his gratitude to remix her.

While surfing for information about this electropop release, you read:

> "Emily In Love is the side project of Emily, one half of the electropop duo Bisexual Cyborg, a sad Australian girl who makes dreamy indiepop/folk/tronica for herself and her imaginary cats."

Corpid Netlabel is quite known for its careful and earnest remixes for its own ladies. Just remember the excellent [Bobby Baby-Remixes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/electronica-indietronic/250-bobby-baby-loves-to-remix-vol-1-corpid-netlabel "Free MP3 Music ")! This time Lucky Misu, Rupert Falsch and Microholiday got invited by Emily in Love. And, yes they took the rendez-vous serious and did a very nice job. I guess, Emily will invite them for another tête-à-tête soon... Just listen to "Outside to play" and "Lullaby (Rupert Falsch Remix)" and **enjoy some playful, melancholic but melodic pop**.
