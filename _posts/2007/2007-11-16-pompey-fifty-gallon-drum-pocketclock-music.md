**Bewildering Pop Music** // The Internet exhales the strangest musical ideas. Some are awesome, some dull, most of them are simply boring. Rowan McNaught's Pop-experiments are worth a listen - though I bet some of you might disagree. The [experimental Pop-tunes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/101-pompey-fifty-gallon-drum-pocketclock-music) he releases under the name of Pompey refuse any proper classification. He switches from lo-fi Electroacoustica to Ambient to Avant-Pop like changing your underwear. Connecting element: the sound of the gallon drum.<!--more-->

After an EP and a full-length album in 2005, "[Fifty Gallon Drum](http://pocketclock.org/releases/cl006.html "Fiftly Gallon Drum @ Pocketclock Music")" is the latest record by [Pompey](http://www.myspace.com/pompeycasmilus "Pompey @ Myspace"). It's out on [Pocketclock Music](http://pocketclock.org/ "Pocketclock Music Website"), a small Australian Netlabel that features _The Sound of Young Melbourne_. The Music on the new [Pompey](http://www.myspace.com/pompeycasmilus "Pompey @ Myspace") album is made of uneven rhythmic drum-patterns, gallon drums, synthesizers, some skew vocals and a handful of tiny noises. Less guitars than on the previous releases, Rowan moved his music closer to Fine Arts than Indierock. If a collapsing tower of gaudy building bricks will ever need a soundtrack, it'll be [Pompey](http://www.myspace.com/pompeycasmilus "Pompey @ Myspace"). Check the video for "Feet Miniature" for reference:

The [Pompey](http://www.myspace.com/pompeycasmilus "Pompey @ Myspace") songs preserve a strong improvisational sense, they seem like sketches that have been recorded accidentally. Still there a beautiful melodies and structures that justify the drawer Pop music. Some people probably dislike Rowan's loose tunes. But if you're into _Can_, _The Beta Band_, _Animal Collective_ or Russian [Gultskra Artikler](http://myspace.com/gultskra "Gultskra Artikler @ Myspace"), you probably dig the [Pompey](http://www.myspace.com/pompeycasmilus "Pompey @ Myspace")-muzak.
