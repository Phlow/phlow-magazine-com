**Electro Pop** // [ccMixter](http://ccmixter.org/) is a community music remixing website featuring remixes and samples licensed under [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licenses. One musician who used ccMixter quite cleverly is [Calendar Girl]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/interview-portrait/509-calendar-songs-a-delicate-creative-commons-project). Over one year she recorded each month a song, packed the vocals on ccMixter and asked the community to remix. One producer who did a hell of a job is apeskinny who remixed the may-song and turned it into an electrifying techno-pop-song.
