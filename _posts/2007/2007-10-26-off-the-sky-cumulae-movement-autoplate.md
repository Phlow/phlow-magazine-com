**Organic Ambient Symphony** // Jason Corder, the civil name behind the offthesky-moniker, is back with an epic one-track EP. "Cumulae Movements" is sort of a teaser for his upcoming full-length release at <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Autoplate</span>, and if you consider the duration of nearby 30 minutes of this single tune I'm a bit anxious what "full-length" will mean... Nevertheless, if Kentucky-based Corder manages to maintain the quality of his eclectic ambient music like he does on "Cumulae Movement" for a whole album, we got to re-arrange our best of 2007-lists.<!--more-->

Jason Corder is into Netaudio since 2000, appearing under a whole bunch of names, switching from Ambient to Postrock to atmospheric Techno like it's no deal. After all, [Off the Sky](http://www.offthesky.com "Off the Sky Website") seems to be his _main_ alias. The title of Corder's third <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Autoplate</span> installation "[Cumulae Movement](http://autoplate.cc/releases.php?r=apl049 "Off the Sky @ Autoplate")" refers to the formation of thunder clouds ([cumulo nimbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus "Cumulo Nimbus @ Wikipedia")) that can build impressive clusters, announcing rain and tempest.

Influenced by _field-recordings and weather pattern data_ ([offthesky.com](http://www.offthesky.com/about.htm "About Off the Sky")), Jason Corder injects his dense Ambient music with the unreal and slightly menacing atmosphere of a threatening thunderstorm. Highly processed field-recordings and all kinds of warm glitches form his music alongside huge harmonic synthesizer-textures, clean and amplified guitar, sketches of piano and a few subliminal beats. Beautiful and eclectic, experimental yet enjoyable.
