Wow! Netlabel [Thinner](http://thinner.cc) relaunches the website and releases its 100th netaudio-album. And of course, it's an compilation with music from most well-known producers like Sensual Physics, [Benfay]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/house/23-tribute-to-benfay), Laura Palmer, Veer, Brian Kage, Eloi Brunelle and Deluge. But Thinner not only shows us its new dresses. No, there's a lot more waiting to discover. Next to the music downloads in even higher encoding quality like the lossless music-format FLAC and 320-kbps-encoded MP3s, Thinner rewards us with a new business weblog called [thinnerism.cc](http://thinnerism.cc) and a new elegant and smooth uptodated webdesign in black with a new corporate identity.

[Have a look](http://www.thinner.cc) and wait till monday for our review for the anniversary compilation simply called 100!
