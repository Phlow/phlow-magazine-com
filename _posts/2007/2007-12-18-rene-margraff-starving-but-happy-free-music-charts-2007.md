René Margraff is based in Berlin and co-runs [Starving But Happy!](http://www.starvingbuthappy.com) Netlabel together with Nicolas Saez (Brussels, Belgium). Apart from that he used to do music as [ckid](http://ckid.de/), but recently decided to express his contempt incognito: another new "official" project should be announced very soon. If you live in Berlin and want to start a band, get in [contact](mailto:hey[at]ckid[dot]de). As this guy is already quite an old bone, he is also a freelance writer for German [De:Bug](http://www.de-bug.de) magazine since a whole bunch of time. René rarely updates his blog [www.casioheart.de](http://www.casioheart.de) as he spends too much time fiddling with delay pedals.<!--more-->
