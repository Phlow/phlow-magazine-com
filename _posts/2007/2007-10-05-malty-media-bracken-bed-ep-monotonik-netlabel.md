Malty Media ship some dubby, laid-back and groovy mp3s in our inbox. Like [The Orb](http://www.theorb.com/) you never know what loop, which sound and what funny idea are behind the next corner while listening to the four tracks. Frazzles of voices surround sunny reggae-basslines, beautiful vocals give you a peaceful feeling. Meanwhile the beats play with the drumsticks.<!--more-->

The “Bracken Bed EP” is real fun. Humour, good vibrations and haunting melodies are all in motion when you cut loose and enjoy the tracks from a couple of dangerous New Zealand natives - Aquaboogie and long-time electronic musician and Japanese resident Jet Jaguar. They’ve kindly formed the special duo named Malty Media and entertain us with a nostalgic 4-track EP which embraces music-genres from downbeat to jungle to ambient.
