**Downbeats, Jungle and a handful of dub** // Malty Media ship some dubby, laid-back and groovy mp3s in our inbox. Like [The Orb](http://www.theorb.com/) you never know what loop, which sound and what funny idea are behind the next corner while listening to the four tracks. Frazzles of voices surround sunny reggae-basslines, beautiful vocals give you a peaceful feeling. Meanwhile the beats play with the drumsticks.<!--more-->

The ["Bracken Bed EP"](http://www.mono211.com/content/releases/mtkmp189.html) is real fun. Humour, good vibrations and haunting melodies are all in motion when you cut loose and enjoy the tracks from a couple of dangerous New Zealand natives - [Aquaboogie](http://mono211.com/content/releases/mtkmp33.html) and long-time electronic musician and Japanese resident [Jet Jaguar](http://www.virb.com/jetjaguar/). They've kindly formed the special duo named Malty Media and entertain us with a nostalgic 4-track EP which embraces music-genres from downbeat to jungle to ambient.
