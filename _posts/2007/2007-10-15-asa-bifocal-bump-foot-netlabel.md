***Relaxed and hypntoic House*** // The japanese musician Asa knows how to keep the tension. While we're hooked on his [melodic endless grooves]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/house/54-asa-bifocal-bump-foot-netlabel) he carefully builds his tracks and adds slightly new musical elements. His house-music catches and carries us into some sort of peaceful condition in which we float on calm, bleeping and sweet synthesizer sounds.

"Bifocal" is a hypnotic 3-tracker release on the non-profit [Bump Foot netlabel](http://www.bumpfoot.net/) from Japan. While "blue zone" is a more techno-orientated track "bifocal" and "wind focus" drift on melodic grooves. While "wind focus" keeps a more deep house-focus the title track "bifocal" melts us with sweet melodies. Listening to "bifocal" feels like lying lazy in the sun at the beach. I guess it's time for some sweet dreams.

PS: The only thing which strikes me a little bit is the sudden end of the tracks.
