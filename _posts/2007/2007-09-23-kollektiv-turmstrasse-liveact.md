**Spherical Techno-Trance-Liveact** // Kollektiv Turmstrasse started years ago with their netlabel called [No-Response](http://www.no-response.org/). They hit the scene with a melodious Dub-Techno-EP called ["new weakness EP"](http://www.no-response.org/no-response-releases/release_details.php?relid=2). We loved their debut. Meanwhile Nico Plagemann and Christian Hilscher from Luebeck, Germany, kept been busy and founded a vinyl label called ["Musik gewinnt Freunde"](http://musik-gewinnt-freunde.de/). While they happily distribute their new sounds via [Kompakt](http://www.kompakt-net.com/), they spoil us with floating liveacts.<!--more-->

So nowadays Kollektiv Turmstrasse amaze the Techno-Underground with one fabulous liveact after another. Their style could be described as floating and kicking techno with some nostalgic looks backwards when trance was still underground and sweeping melodies a reason to let it go. Their recorded liveact shows us how entertaining a night with Kollektiv Turmstrasse could be.
