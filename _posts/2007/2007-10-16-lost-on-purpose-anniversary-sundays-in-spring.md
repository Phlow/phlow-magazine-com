***Guitar Folk-Pop*** // Lost on Purpose is L.A.-based one-man indie band Will Holland. His ["Anniversary" EP]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/pop/46-lost-on-purpose-anniversary-sundays-in-spring) was released on Belgian Sundays at Spring-Netlabel back in 2005 and can cope with most of the commercial indie Pop outlets easily. _Elliot Smith_, _The Shins_, _Modest Mouse_? Don't spend your expensive listening time on _them_, get this unpolished nugget into your ears!<!--more-->

Next to [V.O.](http://www.myspace.com/voband "V.O. @ Myspace"), [Pokett](http://www.myspace.com/pokett "Pokett @ Myspace") and [Sepia Hours](http://www.myspace.com/sepiahours "Sepia Hours @ Myspace"), [Lost on Purpose](http://www.lostonpurpose.com "Lost on Purpose Website") has always been my favourite in the [Sundays in Spring](http://www.sundaysinspring.net "Sundays in Spring Website")-back catalogue. Will's EP opens with "London". Acoustic guitar, harmonica, good vocal-harmonies and some sketches of piano, that's everything Will Holland needs to construct a clever indie Pop song.

"Ohio 2" afterwards is based on a wonderful piano-backing and the layered vocals that sound a bit like Minnesota's finest _Low_. Phew! "Lonely Road" is a up-tempo masher with tight acoustic guitar and four-to-he-floor handclaps, while “Thank you Music Guru” comes off with sugar-sweet vocal chords and intimate guitar-play. Like _Yo La Tengo_ backing up for _Elliot Smith_. While everybody needs to quote influences from British bands nowadays, Will Holland’s American indie Pop-music is like a glass of aged whiskey in a display of neon-coloured alcopops
