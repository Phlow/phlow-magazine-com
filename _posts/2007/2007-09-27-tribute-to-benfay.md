Benfay lives in Bern, Switzerland, and is one of the early netaudio-artists who released his music on the web. His first releases can be found on the highly proclaimed Thinner netlabel. While Benfay produced pushing and Detroit-inspired tracks in the beginning like [Bonnie Mandarin](http://de.scene.org/pub/music/groups/thinner/%5Bthn007%5D_b1_benfay-bonnie_mandarin.mp3) (MP3) on his Carbon EP, he later composed more smooth and melodic tracks.

But Benfay didn't only produce music for Thinner, he even mastered as engineer some of the most popular Thinner-releases. Later on he opened his own netlabel together with Digitalis and [Sam Graf](http://sgis.ch/). They called their now resting netlabel [Realaudio](http://www.realaudio.ch/). There you'll find Benfays album ["albedo feature"](http://realaudio.ch/amb/raam007.html), where he focused on ambient and experimental sounds.

One of my favorite Benfay-albums is his ["One Touch Button Music LP"](http://thinner.cc/releases.php?r=thn054). On this album Benfay combines various musicstyles from ambient to electronica to dub-inspired techno-tracks. His ambient-track ["Plötzliche Kühle" (MP3)](http://de.scene.org/pub/music/groups/thinner/%5Bthn054%5D_08-benfay_-_pl%F6tzliche_k%FChle.mp3)
  
[Benfay Thinner Bio](http://thinner.cc/artists.php?id=3) is definetely one of my all-time-netaudio favourites. Don't miss the amazing [remix of "Plötzliche Kühle " by Lufth (MP3)](http://de.scene.org/pub/music/groups/thinner/%5Bthn060%5D_06-benfay_-_pl%F6tzliche_k%FChle_remix-lufth_remix.mp3) on ["One Touch Button Remixes LP"](http://thinner.cc/releases.php?r=thn060). Both ambient-works cool you down with mellow melodies and an individual cinematic vibe.

The latest production from Benfay ["Born On A Houseboat"](http://thinner.cc/releases.php?r=thn096) sadly didn't convince me very much. Only his shuffle-house-track ["Phlegmatic Face"](http://de.scene.org/pub/music/groups/thinner/%5Bthn096%5D-02-benfay_-_phlegmatic_face.mp3) grabs you by the scruff of your neck and pushes you gently on the dancefloor.
