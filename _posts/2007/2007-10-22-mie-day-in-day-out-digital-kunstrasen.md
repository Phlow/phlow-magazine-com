**Tiny Bits of Ambient Bliss |** Most ambient music is made for expanded listening. Sounds are shifted in slow-motion and every single event can unfold itself in perfect balance. Usually, an ambient track works totally different than a 3:30-Pop song. With the new EP by sound-designer miè, Digital Kunstrasen gain prove for the fact that ambient tunes may function in even less than ten minutes.<!--more-->

[miè](http://www.myspace.com/mientertaining "miè @ Myspace") is Martin Seidel, a young fellow from the city of Leipzig in Eastern Germany. You might know him for his nice debut EP “[Subjektive Perspektiven](http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/6/1/1133066/mie-subjektive%20perspektiven.zip "Subjektive Perspektiven Download")” or his appearance at the second “[Electronica Unplugged](http://aerotone.300l600.de/index.php?id=2,41,0,0,1,0 "Electronica Unplugged 2 @ Aerotone")”-sampler at [Aerotone](http://aerotone.de "Aerotone Website").

“[Day in, Day out](http://www.digitalkunstrasen.net/kunstrasen/release_detail.php?release=dka032&lng=en "miè @ Digital Kunstrasen")” is his first work for [Digital Kunstrasen](http://www.digitalkunstrasen.net/kunstrasen/ "Digital Kunstrasen Website"). It’s made of five diverting little sketches of Ambient and low-energy IDM. “Mangle my Nightmare” comes up with some beautiful textures, both synthesized and sampled. Experimental yet tonal and harmonic. “Commen Behaviour” is subtle Electronica, introducing a more rhythmical corset for Martin’s soundscapes. For the final track “Meubl”, [miè](http://www.myspace.com/mientertaining "miè @ Myspace") teamed up with French producer [Pixe](http://www.myspace.com/pixecell "Pixe @ Myspace") whose beats are a bit more crunchy. The songs on “[Day in, Day out](http://www.digitalkunstrasen.net/kunstrasen/release_detail.php?release=dka032&lng=en "miè @ Digital Kunstrasen")” are not longer than 4:30, getting to the point outright. That works quite well and makes the music easily consumable, still I’d wish to hear the mentioned songs in sort of "extended" versions.
