With musicians like Veer, Sensual Physics, Laura Palmer and Brian Kage. A delicate and futuristic trip in accurate quality ranging from 320kbit-mp3s to lossless-compression in flac-format.<!--more-->

"100" puts more fuel in your techno- and house-driven mp3-player. While some tracks like "Borderline" from Laura Palmer lift you slightly up with Progressive House, tracks like "Greet the World with a smile" from Veer stick a little flag into the musical map somewhere inbetween Rhythm & Sound and Luomo. But we get some carefully rockin tracks, too. At the forefront Eloi Brunelle from Epsilonlab/Canada kicks us with "Deepmush" sincere in the butt. His track melts some stompy disco-drums with technoid chords and playful sounds. The most atmospheric production catches us when we drift on off-beat synthesizers-chords from Brian Kage. Nice.
