<img class="right" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/rop002.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Direwires & Freder - Sleeping Near Highways - Front" />**Aural Tour-Diary** // [Direwires](http://www.myspace.com/direwires "Direwires @ myspace.com") is Adam Young of Ontario, a recording artist and founder of Robotopera Netlabel (it’s a shame the label is on hiatus right now but their releases are accessible via [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/robotopera "Robotopera @ archive.org")). Anyway, [Sleeping Near Highways](http://www.archive.org/details/rop002 "Sleeping Near Highways @ Robotopera") is a collaboration-project from Young and label-buddy Freder who travelled Canada for a while and found themselves, well, _sleeping near highways_ during this time. Their music is made of delayed synth-chords, expanded field-recordings and a lot of space between the tones. Some kind of aural tour-diary which reflects the eerie feeling of being away from home, bored and trapped somewhere alongside the road.<!--more-->

[Prelude to Sleep](http://www.archive.org/download/rop002/01_Prelude_to_Sleep.mp3 "Prelude to Sleep MP3") is a simple composition that’s mainly based on a filter-modulated synth sound. Very warm, very relaxing, though there’s some kind of bad premonition left- this sleep will bring you nightmares. [Glowing Through Eyelids](http://www.archive.org/download/rop002/02_Glowing_Through_Eyelids.mp3 "Glowing through Eyelids MP3") is the awaking afterwards. Like the song of a bird when the sun rises, morning rushes in with tender synthesizer-chirping. While this tune could have been released on [Autoplate](http://autoplate.cc/ "Autoplate Netlabel") without a problem, most of the other songs on [Sleeping Near Highways](http://www.archive.org/details/rop002 "Sleeping Near Highways @ Robotopera") contain certain elements of experimental Rock music that make them more difficult to categorize. Innovative and hypnotizing.
