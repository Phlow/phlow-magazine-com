***Netaudio London 2008 Photos*** // Some people write texts, others compose music, Simon Bierwald aka Sim Sullen shoots beautiful photos and gives you a slight glimpse how amazing and fun it was to take part in Netaudio London 2008. Fortunately he already uploaded some of the hundred shots he made while walking through the underground hallways of London Bridge.

Sneak with us backstage... Have a look how we enjoyed late mornings discussing the future of music, upcoming festivals like <a href="http://netaudioberlin.de" target="_blank">Netaudio Berlin</a> and <a href="http://netaudio-cologne.de" target="_blank">Netaudio Cologne</a> and enjoy visiting virtually one of our planets most interesting cities to dive into music of all kind.

Lean back and enjoy the pictures while listening to a Brigitte Bijoux track mo. played at the Shunt (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simsullen/tags/netaudiolondon08/show/" target="_blank">hi-res photo diashow</a>), hop over to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/simsullen" target="_blank">www.flickr.com/simsullen</a> and leave some comments or tag the pictures if you like!
