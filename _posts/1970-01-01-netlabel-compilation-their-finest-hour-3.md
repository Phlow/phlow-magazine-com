## mo.'s little note

[Soto]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/pop/265-soto-soto-ep-creation-centre) was the brightest discovery for me in March. While fumbling around with my telescope to discover new electronic music, Sven published his wonderful discovery. The pop-group from Japan sneaked directly into my heart and that's why Soto had to be the hugging brace for our third Best-Of-Netlabels-compilation.

As always we tried hard to combine the most impressive music-moments to one phlowtin' music-sampler. I hope you enjoy the diversity of sounds... And if you do so: **Smile back and leave a note on the websites of your favorite musicians!** They're thirsty for feedback, so why not saying: Thank you for your music!

Greets from Cologne/Germany, Yours mo.
