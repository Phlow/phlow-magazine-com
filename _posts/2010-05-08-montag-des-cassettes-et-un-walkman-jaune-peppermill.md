It is good practice at [Peppermill Records](http://www.peppermillrecords.com/) not to make to many words about their releases. Typically this is not necessary as every releases speaks for itself, and this is especially true when you consider Montags' ["Des Cassettes et un Walkman Jaune"](http://www.peppermillrecords.com/pm015).

Montag is Vancouver-based <a href="http://www.montag.ca/" target="_blank">Antoine Bédard</a>. **On this little EP, the man reworks adolescence favourites in his very own styles of warm synth arrangements, leftfield singing and Disco beats.** We get to hear popular songs by _PM Dawn_, _Bronski Beat_ and _Eurythmics_ as well as a _Breeders_, _Unrest_ and _Low_ cover.

Interestingly, the 90s songs and the 80s songs go together very well. This is mainly because Antoine makes the tender Indierock of the likes named atop sound 80s whilst leaving his Synthpop idols rather untouched. One might criticize this as too soft and artless. Myself I enjoy the lush and nostalgic melodies and meanwhile consider the possibility to purchase his latest album ["Going Places"](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dvfuxzy5ldde~T00).
