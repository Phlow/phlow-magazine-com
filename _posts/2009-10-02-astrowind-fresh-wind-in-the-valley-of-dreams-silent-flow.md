***Where The Wild Synths At*** // Blame me to be an anachronistic fool. Call me old-fashioned. Still I got to let you know: an analogue synthesizer sounds better than a digital one. It may act like a diva (detunes randomly, hisses like hell) but eventually you get a sound that has soul and a physical form. The Latvian duo Astrowind took the hard road and conquered their machines.

<a href="http://astrowind.net" target="_blank">Astrowind</a> are Kriipis Tulo and Mahi Bukimi. I follow them since their first releases at long-gone <a href="http://excentrica.org/" target="_blank">ElektroSound</a> Netlabel and their retro-style synthesizer Ambient always made a little bell ring in my head. After two record that did not get me too much, this one is just right again. "<a href="http://silent.com.md/label/2009/09/29/astrowind-fresh-wind-in-the-valley-of-dreams/" target="_blank">Fresh Wind in the Valley of Dreams</a>" is released on the young Moldavian Netlabel <a href="http://silent.com.md/label/" target="_blank">Silent Flow</a>.

<a href="http://astrowind.net/" target="_blank">Astrowind</a> play old Russian synthesizer, record their jams live on tape (!) to carefully rework them at home (I love the idea they do it with a cutting knife and Scotch tape but I guess on this account they do NOT do analogue). Outcome is multicoloured streams of dense synthesizer Ambient, enhanced by extensive pedal processing and vocal samples from Soviet cosmonautics (In particular, "<a href="http://silent.com.md/label/2009/09/29/astrowind-fresh-wind-in-the-valley-of-dreams/" target="_blank">Fresh Wind in the Valley of Dreams</a>" is dedicated to [A. A. Leonov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Leonov)).

<a href="http://astrowind.net/" target="_blank">Astrowind</a> music flows like water. And like water can vary from runlet to tsunami, Tulo and Bukimi play with dynamics as well. _Modus operandi_ changes from lovely to destructive, from contemplative to rude health - but the overall mood is august mellifluence. The cosmonautics reference works beautifully as well and given this, the link to 70's German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmische_musik" target="_blank">Kosmische Musik</a> ain't too far-fetched. Lovin' it.
