As a Beat Samurai N-Noiz follows the path of Photek and his comrades-in-arms. His "Unbounding The Future EP" is an epic trip with haunting sounds, elaborate chopped-up beats and a unique style which makes every former master proud. You rarely find so deep, complex and intelligent Drum'n'Bass beats.

This is **one fantastic peace of drum'n'bass art**. It's dark, yes. There are no melodic hooks, yes. But if you are a beat addict as I am, you just have to admire the craftful work. You will be sucked into the deep atmosphere.

With enthusiastic love N-Noiz formed outstanding drum'n'bass-tracks. And also if Photek is the sword-swinging leader, N-Noiz has his own fighting style. Just listen how the bass diggs a grave for every opponent, how the beats travel through the stereo field. My only critisism concerns to the last track "Vibin The Crook". There N-Noiz repeated the vocals to much or the MC had no more rhymes in his pocket. Nevertheless the voice by Semtex M fits perfect to the music vibe.

_Dark, powerful and fresh!_
