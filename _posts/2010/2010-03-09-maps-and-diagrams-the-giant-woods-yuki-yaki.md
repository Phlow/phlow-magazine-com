Back on track with a classic Ambient album. "Classic" like GAS, Fennesz, Eno... You know the drill.  Behind the Maps and Diagrams moniker is UK-based Tim Martin, who has a quite [impressive back catalogue](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Maps+&+Diagrams) with various CD, CDr, MP3 and vinyl releases. For "The Giant Woods" Martin teams up with the Yuki Yaki crew. Win-win!

Usually it is hard to put the finger on why an Ambient album is "good". For me, richness, atmosphere and innovative sound design is important. While "[The Giant Woods](http://www.yukiyaki.org/releases/YkYk019/maps-and-diagrams/The-Giant-Woods)" could have been transmitted in the early 70's (_soundwise_), the dense and slightly haunting _feel_ of the record got me eventually. The artwork caught that impression very well - a walk through the forest at night, getting lost in a foreign town as the sun is about to settle... The chill comes on soft feet!

Besides, the intense layering and enwinding of different textures creates a sound that allows for aural discoveries on every new listen. Something you can find with [Ian Hawgood]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/555-man-of-taste-ian-d-hawgood-koen-park), [Slow]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/1406-slow-dual-box-resting-bell) or [Astrowind]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/1374-astrowind-fresh-wind-in-the-valley-of-dreams-silent-flow) as well. Dig yourselves into these nine tracks and escape for 48 gracious minutes.
