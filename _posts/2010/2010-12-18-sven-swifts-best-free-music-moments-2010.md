    Sven Swift is one of those people, whos heart is burning for music. Ever since I got to know him, Sven Swift releases music, makes music, makes tapes, makes something experimental as long as it has to do with <em>music</em>. While we wrote reviews on a high output level from 2007 to the beginning of 2010 for <a href="http://Phlow-Magazine.com">Phlow-Magazine.com</a>, we now take it slow - the family has grown.

    Currently Sven Swift focuses totally on his second netlabel - after <a href="http://12rec.net">12rec.net</a> - called <a href="http://error-broadcast.com/">Error Broadcast</a>. And this is also what these charts are about. They are about electronic, abstract, bass-heavy and HipHop-inspired music. I call it <em>Sven Swift's Best Free Music Moments 2010</em> because not all tracks were released under creative commons licence <em>but</em> the musicians uploaded them to the web to spread the music. So go to the websites and download these anthems and enjoy!
