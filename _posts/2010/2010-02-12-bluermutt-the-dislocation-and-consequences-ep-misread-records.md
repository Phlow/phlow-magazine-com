***Electronic Folk Music*** // News from my man Bluermutt, and it is good news! I have been a big fan of his former albums and various [side projects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/258-mickey-eats-plastic-to-kill-the-white-glamour-reworks-ep-1), and the more delighted to hear that this EP will be on for free although the "[Decivilize After Consumption]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/news/824-prgrssbluermutt-decivilice-after-consumption-nexsound-pop)" album was a CD release. These six tracks come off like a collection of songs rather than an EP so I reckon we get outtakes to hear - however, this does not diminish quality in any way.

**Bluermutt**'s "Dislocation (and Consequences)" EP oscillates between highly processed Folk, Krautrock and melodic Electronica. Strength to his compositions is always the strong melodies, governed by a warm and rich production. Maybe this is why I consider **Bluermutt** Pop music rather than anything else- albeit, Pop music with respectable edges.

The first four tracks are breathtaking: "The Broken City" sounds like a dedusted [Harmonia](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:39fwxqu5ldhe) jam, ca. 1974, so full of melancholy sweetness and glittering textures. "Android's Breath" features [Leafcutter John](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:3zftxqwdld6e), soul alike when it comes to "Fractal Folk". His mature yet gentle voice fits the **Bluermutt** sound neatlessly. Wow. "Indoor Failure" eventually is pure candy. Over a [Four Tet](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:dvfpxqqjldhe)-style instrumental, vocals and guitar perform a wonderful Pop melody. Ohrwurm, you were warned! On four, "Single Touch" introduces the ambient part of "The Dislocation (and Consequences)". Warm and cracking Dub, bathed in sunlit harmonies, and a lot of depth: just wonderful.

Support **Bluermutt** by sending over some bucks for the download! "The Dislocation (and Consequences)" EP is available for _pay-as-you-like_ via [bandcamp](http://bluermutt.bandcamp.com/album/the-dislocation-and-consequences-ep).
