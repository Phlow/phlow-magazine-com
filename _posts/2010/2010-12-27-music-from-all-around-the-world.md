With average music listeners in mind, who don't get lost with excitement in dusty box at their record dealer of choice we crafted this compilation. We made our girlfriend listen to the music, asked her for advice and offer you now a true pop music compilation for people who enjoy some happy melodies.

Smile with us listening to melancholic songs from The Black Atlantic or Jsvenes y Sexys from South America. Please push your chair aside and dance to some disco music from Comfort Fit and Opolopo and clap your hands with that four to the floor beat. Laugh about the mad rhymes by Tracky Birthday and get mad with Professor Kliq. Get down with some some downtempo hip hop from fLako and B-Ju and rise your hands again into the air with Henrik Jose.
