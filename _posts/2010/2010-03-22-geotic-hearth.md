***Warm Drones*** // **Geotic** is the Ambient music outfit of Anticon recording artist **Baths** who is active as **Postfoetus**, too. While Baths is biased towards Brainfeeder-style Hip Hop and Postfoetus can clearly be attributed to beatladen Electronica, **Geotic** is all about blurry, harmonious Ambient music.

Behind all these monikers is Californian native Will Wiesenfeld (what a name!). His latest Geotic album "Hearth" was recorded in-between Christmas and New Years Eve 2009. Maybe this is why these ten tracks feel so calm and peaceful, light-minded and warm.

Composed with not essentially more than a guitar, a few keys and vocals, Wiesenfeld manages to deliver an album that is rich in sound and texture but also offers _musical_ qualities many musicians could learn from. "Hearth" may sound like [My Bloody Valentine](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifixqe5ldte) or [Stars of the Lid](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kvfqxq8gld6e) every now and then but remains perfectly unique below the line. Real big, I mean it.

Beautiful art comes from [June Wiesenfeld](http://www.judewiesenfeld.com/).
