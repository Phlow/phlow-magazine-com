A tiny EP is stolen from a blog called "Dust Breeding" which I love a lot. These terribly short however mesmerizing sketches of minimal Ambient and musical processing of environmental noise are something I come back to on a regular basis. As the title already suggests, "For Friends This Winter" is quite an intimate thing, and evertime I listen to it it feels a bit like stalking someone.

"Dust Breeding" is the daily blog Marc Fisher is running in his second year now. Fisher lives in beautyful Portland, is 50% of [Unrecognizable Now](http://unrecnow.com/) and 100% of map~map. Very much what "blogs" used to be in the heyday of the interweb, "Dust Breeding" is about  posting something every day, typically photos and a few personal words. You can find spontaneous recordings, sound experiments and jam sessions there posted, too. This is entertaining at least, inspiring and memorable at best.

["For Friends This Winter"](http://unrecnow.com/dust/2182) was posted the 23. of December 2009. **Six little compositions that engage you with subtle drones and cyclic motives of something that once was melody.** The mood is dark chesnut with a hint of cosy russet. A wonderful and peaceful collection that goes perfectly well with [Geotic]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/1673-geotic-hearth) or [Maps and Diagrams]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/ambient/1669-maps-and-diagrams-the-giant-woods-yuki-yaki), to name just my most recent posts in the Ambient-genre. Love.
