This is pure electronic energetic pop! Let the saw bassline loose and get the people freaked out with some breathy vocals. The electronic funk will do the rest to set the people in motion and the place on fire. AXMusique is a producer duo who melt sexy electro and minimal house together: Sweating bodies and excited girls guaranteed!<!--more-->

I discovered the excellent Brennnessel Netlabel during our creative commons music carnival in december and stumbled upon AXMusique while surfing their website. AXMusique are an example about how sophisticated electronic pop music can sound. With their release you get four songs filled with hypnotic electro-minimal sound.
