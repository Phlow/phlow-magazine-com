It's always fascinating how you can create so much with just some ingredients. For his vision of  Dub Italian musician Para used just organs, delay echoes a warm subbass and some percussion. Together he offers us a beautiful 5-track EP filled up with melodic slow-motion-groovers. A joint venture into the dubby realms of the echobox.<!--more-->

A Quiet Bump cares about quality. Para, too. Slowly he builds up a relaxed mood, uses all the dub trickery to hypnotise us. Unhasty with ease his tunes let their magnetic field work. Get lost in "Stop motion", swim in the bass pool of "Component" and smile while listening to "slow dub". My favorite, by the way...
