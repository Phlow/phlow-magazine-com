***Conference & Festival for Digital Culture*** // For the second time we teamed up with friends in Cologne to organise another Cologne Commons. This year our slogan is _be shareful!_ and we opened the focus on digital culture in general. We invite you to come to our wonderful city from 10th to 12th of June 2010.

We offer you three days of knowledge and culture. The curtain falls with the <a href="http://cologne-commons.de/kinoabend" target="_blank">cinema evening</a> at thursday showing you some of the finest creative commons movies around. On friday and saturday we open your mind and share ideas, knowledge and discuss the future of copyrights, the print media or the state of privacy during our <a href="http://cologne-commons.de/konferenz/546-jurgen-ertelt" target="_blank">conference</a>. While all speeches and discussions will be in english, we have one special panel for you with your favorite netaudio heroes. We called it "Hello world, my name is Netaudio!". In the evening we invited once again musicians from all over Europe, even from Chile, South America to rock the <a href="http://cologne-commons.de/festival" target="_blank">music festival</a>.
