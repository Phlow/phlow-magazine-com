***Stonewashed Electronica*** // It's time to write about Orange Crush. His debut album "The Field"  back in 2006 got me already, but somehow I never managed to review it. Recently, Orange Crush published his second full-length and there is no excuse _not_ to let you know about it eventually. [Fancy lush Downbeat Electronica]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp3-music-download/hiphop/1164-orange-crush-autumn-reflections-archaic-horizon), ca. 1998? Go for it!

Let's start with the obvious reference: _Boards of Canada_. I'm sorry, Karl, you must have heard it a thousand times... The heavy influence of the Scottish pioneers is the reason I never sang the praise of [Orange Crush](http://www.myspace.com/orangecrushmusic) I guess. Solid production, good tracks but something was missing on "[The Field](http://www.archaichorizon.com/releases/ah002/ah002.html)", Endersons' debut for [Archaic Horizon](http://www.archaichorizon.com/). On "[Autumn Reflections](http://www.archaichorizon.com/releases/ah031/ah031.html)", apparently nothing has changed. The improvements, however, are subtle and essential.

Tonal synth- and organ chords, simple three-parts melodies, relaxed Downbeat- and Hip Hop beats, dense instrumentation, loads of atmosphere: the ingredients are the same. Now and back then, [Orange Crush](http://www.myspace.com/orangecrushmusic) sounds dusty, sun-beaten and not much like Vest-Agder in Norway where Endreson lives. A spongy 70's feel is omnipresent throughout the album, certain stems seem to wave and warp like recorded to old tapes.

In the end, it's the melodies that make "[Autumn Reflections](http://www.archaichorizon.com/releases/ah031/ah031.html)" a better record than "[The Field](http://www.archaichorizon.com/releases/ah002/ah002.html)". Enderson is on point and writes _songs_ rather than recording sound ideas. This is a bit more conservative, but it makes a wonderful album that gives you an idea what the Summer in 2009 may taste like. Ace!
