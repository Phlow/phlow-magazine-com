***Peaceful Dubby Trance-Techno*** // Bernard Geiger aka Chillheimer is a sound engineer from Berlin. Publishing his music for free through internet data-highways is a political decision which he explains in detail on his artist-website. As a producer he looks on the bright side of life and his "Morning Moon" EP is a smiling blend of Trance-influenced DubTechno.

"Dreamy" was the first attribut which came to my mind, while listening to the title-track"Morning Moon" on Chillheimers EP released on Rumpfunk Records. Every sound feels warm, in a good-mood and if you play his tunes in the morning hours after a cheerful Club-Night you will surely catch the hearts of the clubbers. If you aren't afraid of some Kitsch also the other tracks will "enlighten" you.
