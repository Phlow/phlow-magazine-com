***Electro-Acoustic Chamber Music*** // US-American composer Scott Smallwood released his music at various experimental Net- and CDR-labels. For his collection "Three Soundscapes", Smallwood and the Now Ensemble gathered to perform three of his most accessible compositions up to date. Neo-classical Ambient at the edge of Noise and Musique Concrète that might mark a good starting point for those who dare to dig deeper.<!--more-->

<!--adsense-->

The album starts with "Colton Swarm". 11:30 minutes mainly build of harmonica- and cello-drones. Enhanced with subtle field-recordings, the whole piece billows up and down, gives rise to noisy wave peaks, uncovers calm clearings and stomachs the careless listener in a whole. Huge. "Stay" is the very step too close to Industrial-music and, although the end is fine, not my cup of machine oil.

So skip and enjoy "Still in Here". For another 10:40 minutes, Smallwood and the [Now Ensemble](http://www.nowensemble.org/ "NOW Ensemble Website") carefully create advanced, acoustic ambient music. Sijis Netlabel put [Smallwood's musical annotations](http://www.archive.org/download/siji19/siji19_ScottSmallwood_StillInHere_score.pdf) in the ZIP-file and it's pretty exciting to follow them. All musicians act with great concentration and intuition for each other. Craftsmanship, despite all the [UGC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content "User Generated Content @ Wikipedia")-hooray, is a stunning thing to observe.
