mnml is a minimalistc Jekyll theme by [Phlow][6]. Its purpose is to be as slim as possible. [I](http://moritz.sauer.io/) needed something pure for my Jekyll experiments so I stripped down the default _Minima_ theme, restructured the CSS to my taste, added my favorite fonts and svg icon-sets.

This theme uses…

…Font Awesome Icons by [Dave Gandy][1] › /_includes/font-awesome-svg  
…Social Media Icons by › [encharm][2] /_includes/svg-social-media  
…[Exo 2][3] font for headlines  
…[Lato][4] font for as the general body font  
…[Inconsolata][5] font as a monospace font for code
